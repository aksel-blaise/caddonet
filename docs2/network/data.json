Recently, however, Goldberg and Lande (2006) pointed out that when phenotypic characters vary along an environmental gradient, the standard approach may fail to identify sympatric character divergence. Here we present a general analytical procedure for identifying sympatric character divergence while accounting for phenotypic changes that covary with environmental variables. Our approach uses residual randomization from a generalized linear model, and allows the statistical comparison of sympatric phenotypic divergence to allopatric phenotypic divergence while accounting for phenotypic variation along a gradient. Through simulation we demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies patterns of sympatric character divergence when they are present, and does not identify such patterns when they are not. Our analytical approach complements and extends the suggestions of Goldberg and Lande (2006), by allowing a full statistical assessment of the varied patterns of character displacement along environmental gradients, or while accounting for other covariates and sources of variation. © 2007 The Author(s).","source":"Scopus","title":"Analysis of character divergence along environmental gradients and other covariates","volume":"61","page start":"510","author(s) id":"7404054540;57074630100;","index keywords":"allopatry; divergence; environmental gradient; phenotypic plasticity; sympatry; adaptation; article; biological model; environment; phenotype; statistical model; Adaptation, Physiological; Environment; Linear Models; Models, Biological; Phenotype","document type":"Article","cited by":"67","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Character displacement; Environmental gradient; Generalized linear model; Phenotypic change; Residual randomization","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Adams D.C., Collyer M.L.","doi":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00063.x"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Moore C.B.","x":446.36309814453125,"y":239.49484252929688,"id":"1460","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-1542599226","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.027972027972027972","year":"1912","page end":"644","source title":"Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Some aboriginal sites on red river","volume":"14","page start":"481","cited by":"26","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"4.0","pr_domain":"0.04195804195804196","authors":"Moore C.B."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":29.428573608398438},{"label":"Thulman D.K.","x":666.6631469726562,"y":995.1038208007812,"id":"1374","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84857117297","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"2012","page end":"1607","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84857117297\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2012.01.004\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dab61ca96cff8608d83742201f68cad84","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Traditional artifact typologies are typically poorly defined. While several attributes usually help define a \" type,\" shape is invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating the types. The results show that the base configurations were best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape, rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further, the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware programs for processing and analyzing shape data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Discriminating Paleoindian point types from Florida using landmark geometric morphometrics","volume":"39","page start":"1599","author(s) id":"33768076600;","index keywords":"archaeology; artifact; geometry; morphometry; symmetry; typology; Florida [United States]; United States","document type":"Article","cited by":"68","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Geometric morphometrics; Hafting; Landmarks; Paleoindian; Symmetry; Typology","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Thulman D.K.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.01.004"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Newcomb Jr. W.W.","x":-636.6980590820312,"y":-451.17388916015625,"id":"1369","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0039082191","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"1961","cited by":"74","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Newcomb Jr. W.W."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Rohlf F.J.","x":-545.5175170898438,"y":1166.38916015625,"id":"1464","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0033235691","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"1999","page end":"223","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0033235691\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs003579900054\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dafe1b218ad4917ce57cf2dee9936bc68","source title":"Journal of Classification","abstract":"The shape of a set of labeled points corresponds to those attributes of the configuration that are invariant to the effects of translation, rotation, and scale.

Clovis may be the best documented Paleoamerican culture in North America, but much remains to be learned about the movement and interactions of Clovis peoples. Similarities among Clovis points from geographically diverse locations have led some researchers to suggest that a uniform projectile point technology existed across North America during Clovis times. Others have rejected this idea, proposing local and independent technological adaptations to different regional environments. To investigate these ideas, we used digital morphometrics to analyze 50 Clovis points from nine different contexts. First, 3D surface models of the points were created with a portable laser scanner. Next, these models were digitally cross-sectioned through both faces, yielding two-dimensional isoheight contours of flake scar patterns that reflect the original reduction techniques used to shape the projectile points. In the final step, the contours were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis into Fourier coefficient series, and patterns of variation and symmetry were explored with principal components analysis. When compared to modern Clovis point replicas made by an expert knapper, the flake scar contours of the ancient Clovis points showed little morphological variation and a large degree of bifacial symmetry. Our results support the existence of a widespread standardized \"Clovis\" knapping technique, most likely transmitted through direct interaction between knappers from different groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Flake scar patterns of Clovis points analyzed with a new digital morphometrics approach: Evidence for direct transmission of technological knowledge across early North America","volume":"39","page start":"3018","author(s) id":"36160611700;7007023049;36652593800;6506757327;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; artifact; digital image; morphometry; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; three-dimensional modeling; tool use; North America","document type":"Article","cited by":"43","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"3D scanning; Contour analysis; Lithic technology; Morphology; Paleoindians; Pleistocene","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Sholts S.B., Stanford D.J., Flores L.M., Wärmländer S.K.T.S.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.04.049"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Walker C.P., Perttula T.K.","x":-671.1499633789062,"y":119.69133758544922,"id":"1428","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649324051","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.02097902097902098","year":"2008","page end":"176","source title":"Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Geophysical investigations on Caddo sites in East Texas and surrounding states","volume":"79","page start":"159","cited by":"6","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"3.0","pr_domain":"0.03496503496503497","authors":"Walker C.P., Perttula T.K."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":22.571428298950195},{"label":"Schambach F.F.","x":189.61785888671875,"y":-297.0254821777344,"id":"1357","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-69549099380","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.027972027972027972","year":"1996","page end":"43","source title":"Mounds, Embankments, and Ceremonialism in the Midsouth","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Mounds, Embankments, and Ceremonialism in the Trans-Mississippi South","volume":"46","page start":"36","cited by":"22","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"4.0","pr_domain":"0.06293706293706294","authors":"Schambach F.F."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":29.428573608398438},{"label":"Selden Jr. R.Z., Perttula T.K.","x":-481.56573486328125,"y":-569.038330078125,"id":"588","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84883221547","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","year":"2013","page end":"96","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84883221547\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2fsea.2013.32.1.007\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da0278be2a23c8748075767fdb9f7fc73","source title":"Southeastern Archaeology","abstract":"Through the employment of radiocarbon (14 C) dates as data, we use the date combination process to refine site-specific summed probability distributions for 555 dates from Caddo sites (n \u003d 19) in East Texas with 10 or more 14C dates.

Remote sensing has considerable potential to lead to long-term collaborative archaeogeophysical and archaeological projects to understand Caddo community-scale organization and landscapes.","source":"Scopus","title":"A revolution in Caddo archaeology: The remote sensing and archaeological view from the hill farm site (41BW169) in Bowie County, Texas","volume":"27","page start":"93","author(s) id":"6508386711;24544904300;24544518600;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; documentary source; mapping; remote sensing; North America; Red River [United States]; United States","document type":"Article","root":"true","cited by":"13","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"4.0","pr_domain":"0.04895104895104895","authors":"Perttula T.K., Walker C.P., Clay Schultz T."},"color":"rgb(102,0,9)","size":29.428573608398438},{"label":"Davis E.M., Gipson J.R.","x":127.04852294921875,"y":64.65436553955078,"id":"1421","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84900897065","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"1960","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Dalton Site: A Late Caddoan Mound Site in the Ferrell\u0027s Bridge Reservoir Area, Northeastern Texas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.027972027972027972","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Davis E.M., Gipson J.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Krieger A.D.","x":-478.31085205078125,"y":-420.3974914550781,"id":"1366","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0039082195","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.02097902097902098","year":"1946","cited by":"35","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"3.0","pr_domain":"0.027972027972027972","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Krieger A.D."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":22.571428298950195},{"label":"Webb C.H.","x":738.097412109375,"y":-261.8459167480469,"id":"1402","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-1542709777","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.027972027972027972","year":"1959","cited by":"16","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Belcher Mound: A Stratified Caddoan Site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"4.0","pr_domain":"0.055944055944055944","title":"The Belcher Mound, A Stratified Caddoan Site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana","authors":"Webb C.H."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":29.428573608398438},{"label":"Adams D.C., Otárola-Castillo E.","x":266.2120361328125,"y":414.7957763671875,"id":"1386","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84875761771","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"2013","page end":"399","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84875761771\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2f2041-210X.12035\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d2d3144c1d1d4ec733b4b43b8717c4368","source title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","abstract":"Many ecological and evolutionary studies seek to explain patterns of shape variation and its covariation with other variables. Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included. Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace. Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform. © 2013 The Authors.

Here we outline a method for testing vectors of phenotypic change in terms of two important attributes: the magnitude of change (vector length) and the direction of change described by trait covariation (angular difference between vectors). We describe a permutation procedure for testing these attributes, which allows non-targeted sources of variation to be held constant. We provide examples that illustrate the importance of considering vector attributes of phenotypic change in biological studies, and we demonstrate how greater inference can be made than by evaluating variance components with MANOVA alone.

These include restricted permutations, permutation of whole groups of units, permutation of some form of residuals or some combination of these. It is unclear, especially for complex designs involving random factors, mixed models or nested hierarchies, just which permutation strategy should be used for any particular test. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (i) we provide a guideline for constructing an exact permutation strategy, where possible, for any individual term in any ANOVA design; and (ii) we provide results of Monte Carlo simulations to compare the level accuracy and power of different permutation strategies in two-way ANOVA, including random and mixed models, nested hierarchies and tests of interaction terms. Simulation results showed that permutation of residuals under a reduced model generally had greater power than the exact test or alternative approximate permutation methods (such as permutation of raw data). In several cases, restricted permutations, in particular, suffered more than other procedures, in terms of loss of power, challenging the conventional wisdom of using this approach. Our simulations also demonstrated that the choice of correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, in accordance with the guideline we provide, is essential for any permutation test, whether it be an exact test or an approximate test.

In this paper, the history of the use of geophysical techniques in archaeology will be discussed, as will significant research themes associated with the most widely used prospecting devices. It is apparent that while the use of geophysical techniques is at an all-time high, there are many key areas where prospecting is rapidly developing. Some of the advances relate to fundamental aspects of the techniques, while others dictate how we undertake survey in the future. There is a movement away from pre-gridded survey areas towards real-time GPS for navigation. This allows greater integration, or fusion, of disparate data sources using visualization techniques derived from associated disciplines. The analysis of landscapes has become a major component of the application of new technology and there are many challenges to be tackled, including how to analyse and interpret significant archaeology within large-scale, data-rich, multi-technique investigations.

This practice results in confusions when large-scale assemblage comparisons are made with the aim of investigating phylogenetic relationships, as functional and cultural information is aggregated. It is argued here that functional criteria must be assessed separately, and that resharpening, as a uniform, repeated, conscious behavioral process of tool maintenance that indexes use and function, can provide a solution to this problem. The subject of this article is a quantitative method for extracting and comparing resharpening trajectories. The method is an adaptation of ontogenetic scaling methods from biology, and is based on obtaining a mathematical representation of shape and size, and finding a relationship between the two. Elliptical Fourier analysis is applied to stone tool contours in order to extract shape information, and then a series of regressions of shape on size provide trajectory vectors. The angles between these are then calculated and subjected to a variety of multivariate statistical tests. A case study involving several European Middle Paleolithic bifacial and unifacial tool assemblages is presented. The results show that resharpening and maintenance can be independent of morphology and technology, suggesting that there are strong grounds for focusing on functional systematics separately. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The Moundville appearances of the interregional distribution of SECC images are useful for analysis because they are part of a large local collection which has been well studied and can thus be quantified (Steponaitis 1983). An examination of the Moundville SECC imagery reveals five images that seem to be closely related - hand-and-eye, skull, bone, winged serpent, and raptor (Fig. 8.1). Of the five motifs, the winged serpent and the hand-and-eye appear most frequently. In Steponaitis\u0027s catalog they are listed thirty-three and thirty-one times, respectively. The hand-and-eye motif appears to be the connector for the cluster, appearing in connection with all of the other motifs. On twenty vessels it is found alone; on seven it appears with bones; and on two it has a skull with it. The hand-and-eye motif also appears once with a raptor head and once with a winged serpent, but the raptor is alone in its other eleven showings, and the winged serpent stands alone on its other thirty-two bottles. Finally, the skull and bone appear together on three vessels. Neither the skull nor the bone ever appears alone on the ceramics at Moundville, according to Steponaitis\u0027s listing (Steponaitis 1983). This cluster of five motifs thus is distinctive in the Moundville iconographic corpus, for it has no other associations. Each of the motifs stands alone or in association with one of the other four. They appear together, but they do not appear randomly in conjunction with the many other images of the SECC. That pattern suggests that the five images are related - hand-and-eye, skull, bones, raptor, and winged serpent belong together in a single iconographic complex. This discrete grouping of five SECC images is the focus of this chapter. Although the evidence is complicated, the argument is simple: the artistic cluster illustrates a complex of beliefs regarding the death of human beings. The mortuary belief complex in question manifests variation in ethnographic details from one tribal group to another, as might be expected, but there is a unifying metaphor which argues for a common core of belief across the Eastern Woodlands and Plains, and probably far beyond that area. That unifying notion is an understanding of the Milky Way as the path on which the souls of the deceased must walk. Demonstrating this interpretation of the iconographic cluster is a complicated problem, for it involves analyzing ethnographic notes and myth texts from a large geographical area, coupled with ethnoastronomical considerations, to produce a synthetic model of the Path of Souls belief complex. That model must then be matched with the iconographic cluster to offer plausible meanings for the images as they were used in the art of Moundville and other SECC sites. What will be offered here is a generalized model of the Path of Souls complex, with examples of the SECC iconographic images from Moundville as they might have fit into the overall mortuary belief pattern. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

Distinctive types of specialization develop in response to various social, economic, and environmental factors, including the demand for crafts, the social relations of producers, and the support base for artisans. These factors in turn influence manufacturing technology. Thus, different types of specialization can be characterized by a technological profile, which reflects relative labor investment, skill, and standardization. An analysis of Prehispanic ceramic technology in the central sierra of Peru demonstrates how these technological profiles can be used to identify the ways ceramic production was organized to provision consumers with utilitarian and luxury pottery. As we demonstrate in our analysis of pottery recovered in the Yanamarca Valley, utilitarian Wanka-style cookwares and storage jars were produced by independent household-based artisans, while imperial Inka-style jars were produced by locally recruited corvee labor working for the state.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","source":"Scopus","title":"Advances in Geometric morphometrics","funding text 1":"Acknowledgements We are grateful to Simon Huttegger, Astrid Jütte, and Matthew Skinner for valuable comments on the manuscript and thank Fred Bookstein, Dennis Slice, and Jim Rohlf for discussion.

The geometric morphometric analysis here takes outline data from a previously studied collection of projectile points and uses elliptical Fourier harmonics analysis combined with principal components and discriminant functions tests to objectively define and separate the two types of projectile point. The result is a bimodal distribution of types that conforms to the traditional typological classification system for the region, in contrast to recent scholarship that conflates the two types into one.

The Acheulian data set is based on previously published data with the addition here of a study of the handaxes from the site of Boxgrove, England. The MTA data set is based on four classic sites from southwest France with large handaxe collections. Both standard caliper-based morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis applied to coordinate data taken from digitized images of handaxes are used to assess shape. The result is that, contrary to expectations based on assumptions of evolving technological skill, handaxes in the MTA are as or more variable in shape than Acheulian ones. This variation is allometric in Acheulian handaxes, and is linked to resharpening from the tip down to the base, but is not related to size in the MTA samples. These results suggest that the goals and constraints of handaxe manufacture, but particularly handaxe reduction as a result of reworking during use, were quite different in the MTA and Acheulian, implying that conclusions about hominin cognition drawn from patterns in shape variability in handaxes must be understood in the context of artifact life histories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"The handaxe reloaded: A morphometric reassessment of Acheulian and Middle Paleolithic handaxes","funding text 1":"RI and SPM wish to thank Alain Turq and Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle (Musée National de Préhistoire, Les-Eyzies-de-Tayac, France) for access to the MTA collections, and RI thanks Nick Ashton (British Museum) and Mark Roberts (University College London) for access to the Boxgrove collection.

Many types of axe have been identified, some of which have numerous variant forms. In the current French terminology, all axes are divided into two generic groups: namely \"Atlantic\" (Atlantique) and \"Eastern\" (Orientale). Each of these generic groups, however, is highly polymorphic, so that it is often very difficult for the operator to classify individual axes with absolute confidence and certainty. In order to overcome such problems, a new shape classification is proposed, using morphometric analysis (Elliptic Fourier Analysis) followed by unsupervised model-based clustering and discriminant analysis, both based on Gaussian mixture modelling. Together, these methods produce a clearer pattern, which is independently validated by the spatial distribution of the findings, and multinomial scan statistics. This approach is fast, reproducible, and operator-independent, allowing artefacts of unknown membership to be classified rapidly. The method is designed to be amendable by the introduction of new artefacts, in the light of future discoveries. This method can be adapted to suit many other archaeological artefacts, providing information about the material, social and cultural relations of ancient populations. © 2015.","source":"Scopus","title":"Unsupervised model-based clustering for typological classification of Middle Bronze Age flanged axes","volume":"3","page start":"381","author(s) id":"56272838100;7003488151;36902120100;8335515700;56717376600;23484256000;","document type":"Article","cited by":"5","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Archaeology; Bronze age; Closed contour; Elliptic fourier analysis; Flanged axes; Gaussian mixture modelling; Morphometrics; Self-organizing maps; Typology","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Wilczek J., Monna F., Gabillot M., Navarro N., Rusch L., Chateau C.","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.06.030"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Perttula T.K.","x":-587.7603759765625,"y":-814.0349731445312,"id":"1394","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-43749120948","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"2008","page end":"105","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-43749120948\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2fpan.2008.006\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d866130e1d2e89ab3b92eef5c4bfe403d","source title":"Plains Anthropologist","abstract":"Tropical cultigens were adopted and used by the Caddo peoples and their ancestors beginning perhaps 2,000-2,500 years ago on the western frontier of the eastern Woodlands.

In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes).

Moore reprint series that covers archaeological discoveries along North American Waterways. Clarence B. Moore (1852-1936), a wealthy Philadelphia socialite, paper company heir, and photographer, made the archaeology of the Southeast his passion. Beginning in the 1870s, Moore systematically explored prehistoric sites along the major waterways of the region, from the Ohio River south to Florida and as far west as Texas, publishing his findings, at his own expense, with the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This volume, the final in a series of nine, includes Moore\u0027s investigations along waterways of Arkansas and Louisiana-the Ouachita, Red, Saline, Black, Tensas, and Atchafalaya Rivers-in three complete field sessions ending in 1909, 1912, and 1913. He located and mapped more than 185 mounds and cemeteries. Artifacts recovered in this territory, such as ceramic effigy pots, earthenware pipes, arrowheads, celts, and projectile points, include some of the most important ones discovered by Moore in his 47 years of excavating. Included in this volume is a CD containing the 69 color illustrations from all the original expedition volumes. The elaborate earthwork of Poverty Point, located in West Carroll Parish, Louisiana, is perhaps the most remarkable archaeological site presented in the volume. In some cases, Moore documented sites along the tributaries that have since been destroyed by river action or looters. In other cases, the National Register of Historic Sites and concerned landowners in Arkansas and Louisiana have preserved the record of aboriginal peoples and their life ways that was first illuminated by Moore\u0027s sophisticated study. © 2003 by The University of Alabama Press.

It is common for researchers in these disciplines to work with multivariate phenotypic data. When phenotypic variables exceed the number of research subjects - data called \u0027high-dimensional data\u0027 - researchers are confronted with analytical challenges. Parametric tests that require high observation to variable ratios present a paradox for researchers, as eliminating variables potentially reduces effect sizes for comparative analyses, yet test statistics require more observations than variables. This problem is exacerbated with data that describe \u0027multidimensional\u0027 phenotypes, whereby a description of phenotype requires high-dimensional data. For example, landmark-based geometric morphometric data use the Cartesian coordinates of (potentially) many anatomical landmarks to describe organismal shape. Collectively such shape variables describe organism shape, although the analysis of each variable, independently, offers little benefit for addressing biological questions. Here we present a nonparametric method of evaluating effect size that is not constrained by the number of phenotypic variables, and motivate its use with example analyses of phenotypic change using geometric morphometric data. Our examples contrast different characterizations of body shape for a desert fish species, associated with measuring and comparing sexual dimorphism between two populations. We demonstrate that using more phenotypic variables can increase effect sizes, and allow for stronger inferences. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","source":"Scopus","title":"A method for analysis of phenotypic change for phenotypes described by high-dimensional data","funding text 1":"This research was supported by a Western Kentucky University Research and Creative Activities Program award (no. 12-8032) to MLC, an NSF REU (DBI 1004665) grant-funded research experience to DJS and NSF grant DEB-1257287 to DCA.

Smith 1995). The knowledge gained about the native American past in the region, about the challenges faced during times of prehistoric cultural change, and during the wrenching episode (still ongoing) of contact and interaction between the Caddo peoples and European and Anglo- American colonizers and settlers (Perttula 1998b) helps to make \"native history\" an integral part of-rather than a footnote to-the ongoing study of Texas\u0027 cultural heritage. While there is every reason to think that our knowledge of northeastern Texas prehistory will continue to grow by leaps and bounds, there are tremendous research and preservation challenges ahead for each prehistoric era. On a mundane level, it is important that we continually cast a critical and discerning eye at our research priorities for prehistoric and Caddoan archeological sites, the value of our methodological approaches, and the worth of our cultural resource management planning documents. From the innovative use of these tools come the new perspectives and conceptions that lead to a broader understanding of the past. Changes in research strategies are critical, but in northeastern Texas they are, unfortunately, only part of the archeological story. Of the utmost concern for the long-term protection and preservation of the region\u0027s priceless archeological heritage is dealing directly with the unabated looting and vandalism of prehistoric Caddo villages and cemeteries-on private as well as state and federal lands (Perttula and Nelson 1999). The archeological landscape is pitted and pocked with the looter\u0027s holes and backdirt piles. Many of the most important archeological sites in the region have been irretrievably damaged and destroyed, and it is questionable that the looting frenzy can be quelled even should an unmarked burial protection bill ever be made law in Texas; the situation is not much better in Arkansas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. The cultural patrimony of the Caddo peoples is being taken from them, with almost no hand being lifted to help protect these significant cultural treasures. This challenge is our greatest in the years ahead: to find a way, in concert with the Caddo people, to protect and preserve this cultural legacy: \"In 1541 when the Spaniards arrived, every place in the Caddo country had, of course, a Caddo name but almost all of those names are gone now, like the people who bestowed them\" (Schambach 1993, 7).

Whereas standard multivariate statistics procedures are fine for \"static\" variation - testing for location differences of groups in multivariate data spaces - they are limited for \"dynamic\" variation - testing specific differences in the ways groups change locations associated with changes in state along ecological, developmental or evolutionary gradients. In this paper, we show that continuous phenotypic change can be described by trajectories in multivariate data spaces. We describe the geometric attributes of phenotypic change trajectories (size, direction, and shape), specifically for GM data. We illustrate, with examples, how differences in such attributes can function as test statistics for comparative analyses in order to understand the mechanisms that produce dynamic differences in shape change. We demonstrate that analysis of such attributes - called phenotypic trajectory analysis (PTA) - is a general analysis that can be applied to various types of research questions concerned with measuring dynamic variation.

This record of human occupation varies with the alluvial style of the river, resulting in each river valley having a unique archeological record controlled by three factors; location of occupation sites, preservation of those sites, and recognition of the sites. If problems of site preservation and recognition in a river valley can be recognized and addressed, a better insight into settlement patterns and complex human-environment interactions can result. This study represents a synthesis of extensive published and secondary data sets pertaining to archaeology and alluvial geomorphology of the lower Missouri, Red, and Mississippi Rivers, to examine the relationship of prehistoric site distribution with fluvial geomorphology. The archeologic data are from published literature and government agencies. The geomorphic data are from a variety of published and unpublished investigations, including maps of alluvial geomorphology, digital elevation models, aerial photographs, and topographic maps. The data were input into spreadsheets and a GIS for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Prehistoric human occupation of the narrow Missouri valley floor is limited, with only 0.061 recorded sites/km2. Additional sites are likely buried by thick vertical accretion sediment on the limited prehistoric portions of the floodplain and within alluvial/colluvial fans along the valley margin. Non-random preservation patterns, such as the absence of sites from the youngest cultural period, are attributed to shifts in settlement patterns. In comparison to the lower Missouri River valley, prehistoric occupation of the lower Red and Mississippi rivers was much more extensive and the density of occupation was 0.274 sites/km2 and 0.277 sites/km2 respectively. Significant differences do exist in the age of sites and their relationship to different floodplain depositional environments. Many sites along the active meander belt of the Red River were likely lost due to high rates of channel migration. Nevertheless, intense occupation of Paleo-Indian through Caddoan groups assures that many significant sites have been preserved. The wide valley and high rates of sedimentation suggest that many sites are likely buried, particularly along natural levees flanking an older meander belt. Recorded sites are also present along streams that incise the terrace, along the terrace margin, and along small channels that cross the backswamp. The spatial and temporal site distribution along the lower Mississippi valley is distinct in comparison with the Red River because the Mississippi valley is wider, the terraces are younger and less dissected, and the floodplain has more relief and is not broadly inundated by floodwater with relatively low sediment concentrations. Most of the significant Archaic through Mississippian period floodplain sites are located along the surfaces of abandoned Mississippi and distributary meander belts which aggraded above the adjacent backswamp and have rarely been influenced by flood sedimentation since abandonment. Abundant Paleo-Indian through Mississippian period sites are also widely distributed across undissected terraces. Only a few significant Mississippian sites are present along the active meander belt and in the backswamp where flooding was common. In comparison with the Red River, the archaeological record of the floodplain is less likely to be influenced by burial or erosion due to the Mississippi River having lower rates of overbank sedimentation and channel migration, respectively. The variable alluvial styles of the lower Missouri River, lower Red River, and the lower Mississippi River valleys presented varying opportunities and constraints to occupation and sustained settlement, and resulted in widely varying archaeological patterns that are partly dependent upon the alluvial geomorphology. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, two comparative methods were proposed to circumvent this difficulty. One obtains phylogenetic independent contrasts for all variables, and statistically evaluates the linear model by permuting the phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) of the response data. The other uses a distance-based approach to obtain coefficients for generalized least squares models (D-PGLS), and subsequently permutes the original data to evaluate the model effects. Here, we show that permuting PICs is not equivalent to permuting the data prior to the analyses as in D-PGLS. We further explain why PICs are not the correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate that this misspecification of permutable units leads to inflated type I error rates of statistical tests. We then show that simply shuffling the original data and recalculating the independent contrasts with each iteration yields significance levels that correspond to those found using D-PGLS. Thus, while summary statistics from methods based on PICs and PGLS are the same, permuting PICs can lead to strikingly different inferential outcomes with respect to statistical and biological inferences. © 2015 The Author(s).","source":"Scopus","title":"Permutation tests for phylogenetic comparative analyses of high-dimensional shape data: What you shuffle matters","volume":"69","page start":"823","author(s) id":"7404054540;57074630100;","index keywords":"comparative study; morphometry; phenotype; phylogenetics; statistical analysis; anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; body size; comparative study; genetics; head; phylogeny; regression analysis; statistical model; Urodela; Animals; Body Size; Head; Least-Squares Analysis; Linear Models; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Urodela","document type":"Article","cited by":"42","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Geometric morphometrics; Phylogenetic comparative method; Phylogenetic generalized least squares; Phylogenetic independent contrasts","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Adams D.C., Collyer M.L.","doi":"10.1111/evo.12596"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Iovita R.","x":-13.703929901123047,"y":1129.7969970703125,"id":"1430","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84455192786","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"2011","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84455192786\u0026doi\u003d10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0029029\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d851ce970229d089e017d89215d2cb4f1","access type":"Open Access","source title":"PLoS ONE","abstract":"Background: Recent findings suggest that the North African Middle Stone Age technocomplex known as the Aterian is both much older than previously assumed, and certainly associated with fossils exhibiting anatomically modern human morphology and behavior. The Aterian is defined by the presence of \u0027tanged\u0027 or \u0027stemmed\u0027 tools, which have been widely assumed to be among the earliest projectile weapon tips. The present study systematically investigates morphological variation in a large sample of Aterian tools to test the hypothesis that these tools were hafted and/or used as projectile weapons. Methodology/Principal Findings: Both classical morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis of tool outlines are used to show that the shape variation in the sample exhibits size-dependent patterns consistent with a reduction of the tools from the tip down, with the tang remaining intact. Additionally, the process of reduction led to increasing side-to-side asymmetries as the tools got smaller. Finally, a comparison of shape-change trajectories between Aterian tools and Late Paleolithic arrowheads from the North German site of Stellmoor reveal significant differences in terms of the amount and location of the variation. Conclusions/Significance: The patterns of size-dependent shape variation strongly support the functional hypothesis of Aterian tools as hafted knives or scrapers with alternating active edges, rather than as weapon tips. Nevertheless, the same morphological patterns are interpreted as one of the earliest evidences for a hafting modification, and for the successful combination of different raw materials (haft and stone tip) into one implement, in itself an important achievement in the evolution of hominin technologies. © 2011 Radu Iovita.","source":"Scopus","title":"Shape variation in aterian tanged tools and the origins of projectile technology: A morphometric perspective on stone tool function","volume":"6","author(s) id":"6506567945;","index keywords":"article; elliptical Fourier analysis; fossil hominin; Fourier analysis; materials; morphometrics; Paleolithic; projectile weapon; Stone Age; tool use; weapon; weight, mass and size; archeology; devices; human; Archaeology; Equipment and Supplies; Fourier Analysis; Humans","document type":"Article","cited by":"66","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e29029","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Iovita R.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0029029"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Lockhart J.J., Green T.J.","x":-379.7688903808594,"y":64.65289306640625,"id":"1384","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-49349105838","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"2006","page end":"32","source title":"Remote Sensing in Archaeology: An Explicitly North American Perspective","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The current and potential role of archaeogeophysics in cultural resource management in the United States","page start":"17","cited by":"7","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.055944055944055944","authors":"Lockhart J.J., Green T.J."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Adams D.C., Rohlf F.J., Slice D.E.","x":43.12381362915039,"y":975.5466918945312,"id":"1445","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84875767161","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"2013","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84875767161\u0026doi\u003d10.4404%2fhystrix-24.1-6283\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d4749c949d41fa0fce54c2e237c53f71c","source title":"Hystrix","abstract":"Twenty years ago, Rohlf and Marcus proclaimed that a \"revolution in morphometrics\" was underway, where classic analyses based on sets of linear distances were being supplanted by geometric approaches making use of the coordinates of anatomical landmarks. Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses.

A sequence of projectile point types was established according to their changes in size and shape. These stone tools, along with others cultural evidences, sensed to differentiate a series of \"cultural periods,\" which were, for decades, the frame of reference to understand the cultural evolution in southernmost Patagonia. Although later researches have questioned several of these assumptions, the classical typology of projectile points continued in use until the present day. The goal of this work is to evaluate size and shape variation in two late Holocene projectile point types, known as Fell. Bird, or Magallanes IV and V points or Patagónicas and Ona points, respectively. These two types are compared using geometric morphometries and multivariate statistical analyses. The reliability in the discrimination between types is tested at the light of reduction. The analyses have shown a major incidence of reduction on shape rather than on size, and on blade rather than on stem. However, in average, types IV and V can be distinguished in terms of size, and stem shape despite reduction. Thus, even though successive cycles of use, damage and resharpening have a great influence over size and shape of projectile points, resharpening techniques are specific enough to maintain the differences of size and shape between types, a pattern that is probably related with functional requirements.

We applied a suite of organic geochemical tools to identify and quantify anthropogenic molecular charcoal fragments in an archaeological site in Panola County, N Texas to determine the provenance of a buried melanic horizon. The site is a small Middle-Late Caddo occupation inhabited principally between ca. 1450 and 1600 AD. We tested three molecular techniques to determine their ability to constrain site formation processes: solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), lignin free phenols and lignin oxidation products (LOPs) and anhydrosugar analysis. We demonstrated that, in conjunction, the three afforded the identification and quantification of anthropogenic molecular charcoal fragments at this archaeological site. The approach allowed reconstruction of the fire history and vegetation type around the site during the occupation period. The NMR and anhydrosugar analysis pointed to temperature conditions associated with thermal refuse in different contexts. In particular, geochemical signatures in a smudge pit indicated a higher combustion temperature than for the charcoals in the other paleosol samples, suggesting multiple fire uses. The data also showed differential persistence of fire signals in environmental samples, likely as a result of differential decomposition rate and solubility, which may lead to heterogeneous fates of different forms of pyrogenic C in the environment.

Most of this research is based on macro-botanical and faunal remains analysis. As an additional line of evidence for the growing body of botanical and faunal data, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen were analyzed from 82 human and faunal samples from the Arkansas basin and Ozark Highlands in eastern Oklahoma. The research investigates the role of maize in diets through time and across sex and status dimensions. Spanning six phases, within the time range 300 B.C. to A.D. 1650, mean δ13C values increase from -19.2 to -12.7 parts per million (%o). Although present prior to A.D. 1000 substantial increases in the use of maize do not begin until the Harlan phase (A.D. 1050-1250).

These test excavations have demonstrated a positive correlation between magnetometer anomalies and the occurrence of Caddo architectural features.","source":"Scopus","title":"Archaeogeophysical investigations at an eighteenth-century caddo site in Nacogdoches County, East Texas","volume":"29","page start":"310","author(s) id":"24544904300;6508386711;","index keywords":"archaeology; eighteenth century; geophysical survey; magnetic anomaly; magnetometer; settlement history; settlement pattern; spatial analysis; Nacogdoches County; Texas; United States","document type":"Article","root":"true","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","pr_domain":"0.0","authors":"Walker C.P., Perttula T.K.","doi":"10.1179/sea.2010.29.2.007"},"color":"rgb(102,0,9)","size":2.0},{"label":"Harrington M.R.","x":-49.59790802001953,"y":-233.07815551757812,"id":"1381","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-31344443035","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.04195804195804196","year":"1920","cited by":"16","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Certain Caddo Sites in Arkansas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"6.0","pr_domain":"0.06293706293706294","title":"Certain Caddo sites in Arkansas","authors":"Harrington M.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":43.14285659790039},{"label":"Kvamme K.L.","x":-173.2589111328125,"y":-35.207542419433594,"id":"1362","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33645082412","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.027972027972027972","year":"2003","page end":"457","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-33645082412\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f3557103\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d1a31c10a2c874fdb4dc80eb4e9bfe8be","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Recent advances in technology and practice allow geophysical surveys in archaeology to produce maps of subsurface features over large areas and in potentially great detail. It is shown through a series of case studies from two regions in North America that archaeo-geophysical surveys can produce primary information suitable for the study of site content, structure and organization, for examining spatial patterns and relationships, and for directly confronting specific questions about a site and the past. Because large buried cultural landscapes can now be revealed, it is argued that an alternative perspective on regional or landscape archaeology may be possible because space can be viewed in terms of tens of hectares as opposed to the lens of square meters typical of archaeological excavations. Moreover, by placing focus on such buried features as dwellings, storage facilities, public structures, middens, fortifications, trails, or garden spaces that are not commonly revealed through most contemporary surface inspection methods, a richer view of archaeology, the past, and cultural landscapes can be achieved. Archaeo-geophysical suneys can also play an important role in Cultural Resource Management (CRM) contexts as feature discovery tools for focusing expensive excavations, thereby reducing the amount needed and lowering costs.

Projecting a phylogeny into morphospace provides estimates of evolutionary trajectories as lineages diversified information that can be used to infer the dynamics of evolutionary processes that produced patterns of morphospace occupation. We present here a large-scale investigation into evolution of morphological variation in the skull of caecilian amphibians, a major clade of vertebrates. Because caecilians are limbless, predominantly fossorial animals, diversification of their skull has occurred within a framework imposed by the functional demands of head-first burrowing. We examined cranial shape in 141 species, over half of known species, using X-ray computed tomography and geometric morphometrics. Mapping an existing phylogeny into the cranial morphospace to estimate the history of morphological change (phylomorphospace), we find a striking pattern: most species occupy distinct clusters in cranial morphospace that closely correspond to the main caecilian clades, and each cluster is separated by unoccupied morphospace. The empty spaces in shape space are unlikely to be caused entirely by extinction or incomplete sampling. The main caecilian clades have different amounts of morphological disparity, but neither clade age nor number of species account for this variation. Cranial shape variation is clearly linked to phyletic divergence, but there is also homoplasy, which is attributed to extrinsic factors associated with head-first digging: features of caecilian crania that have been previously argued to correlate with differential microhabitat use and burrowing ability, such as subterminal and terminal mouths, degree of temporal fenestration (stegokrotaphy/zygokrotaphy), and eyes covered by bone, have evolved and many combinations occur in modern species. We find evidence of morphological convergence in cranial shape, among species that have eyes covered by bone, resulting in a narrow bullet-shaped head. These results reveal a complex history, including early expansion of morphospace and both divergent and convergent evolution resulting in the diversity we observe today. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","source":"Scopus","title":"Evolution of Cranial Shape in Caecilians (Amphibia: Gymnophiona)","funding text 1":"Acknowledgments We thank R.

However, while analyses of phenotypic variation across pairs of evolutionary levels (populations or time steps) are well established, methods for testing hypotheses that compare evolutionary sequences across multiple levels are less developed. Here we describe a general analytical procedure for quantifying and comparing patterns of phenotypic evolution. The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space. Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape), are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa, and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa. This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including: phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth, local adaptation, and biomechanics. We illustrate the approach by examining the phenotypic evolution of several fossil lineages of Globorotalia. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.","source":"Scopus","title":"A general framework for the analysis of phenotypic trajectories in evolutionary studies","volume":"63","page start":"1143","author(s) id":"7404054540;57074630100;","index keywords":"adaptation; evolution; hypothesis testing; phenotypic plasticity; selection; statistical analysis; adaptation; animal; article; biological model; ecology; evolution; fossil; genetic variability; phenotype; phylogeny; species differentiation; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Ecology; Evolution; Fossils; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Models, Genetic; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Globorotalia","document type":"Article","cited by":"144","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Adaptive diversification; Morphological evolution; Ontogeny; Phenotypic change; Phenotypic plasticity; Residual randomization","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.013986013986013986","authors":"Adams D.C., Collyer M.L.","doi":"10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00649.x"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Bolton H.E.","x":-478.5244445800781,"y":-726.0402221679688,"id":"1470","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0040266079","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"1987","cited by":"26","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Hasinais: Southern Caddoans As Seen by the Earliest Europeans","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.02097902097902098","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Bolton H.E."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":15.714286804199219},{"label":"Gero J., Mazzullo J.","x":11.336807250976562,"y":658.630859375,"id":"1376","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84974919616","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"1984","page end":"322","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84974919616\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2f009346984791535467\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d59238d51c0fb05546ab04e579ff79c6d","source title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","abstract":"Standardized, quantified characterization of artifact shape is still problematic insofar as both intuitive shape typologies and multivariate analyses of shape attributes are limited to narrowly defined classes of artifacts exhibiting homologous morphological landmarks.

Two new archeological sites have provided reliable radiocarbon data and for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of northern fluted points is possible. Here, technological and morphological analyses of northern fluted points are presented, including variables statistically evaluated and compared to a collection of fluted Folsom artifacts serving as a reference. Variation in tool shape was measured using geometric morphometrics, and a new approach to landmark placement designed to characterize basal morphology and allow the analysis to include tool fragments is presented. Results confirm that northern fluted points represent a cohesive technological strategy and are used to formulate hypotheses suggesting its service as a risk-management system promoting ease-of-replacement-after-failure to offset transport costs and reduce risk during long-distance travel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","source":"Scopus","title":"The northern fluted point complex: technological and morphological evidence of adaptation and risk in the late Pleistocene-early Holocene Arctic","funding text 1":"Acknowledgments This research was funded by a National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant (Goebel and Smith, grant number 204085, Arctic Social Sciences program) and a Texas A\u0026M University Liberal Arts Dissertation Fellowship.

One long-held explanation for the variation in early Paleoindian point form is that prey size influenced the size and shape of projectile points. The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when both point type and prey size were taken into account, the results ran counter to predictions.

The present report analyzes the adult dentition of hunter-gatherer populations from what is now Texas and compares them with adjacent samples of agriculturalists. These agriculturalist samples represent the Southwestern (Mimbres-Mogollon) and Southeastern (Caddo) cultural spheres. Nonmetric dental traits provide a useful means for evaluating the biological similarities between different populations. Mahalanobis distance analysis of these traits, drawn from 902 individuals, reveal relatively little morphological similarity between hunter-gatherer and farming groups. Except for a sample of Archaic foragers from the gulf coastal plain, hunter-gatherer samples are more similar to each other than to adjacent agriculturalists. Results suggest that Archaic populations were morphologically diverse, while there was relatively little gene flow between hunter-gatherer and farming populations during the Late Prehistoric period. The overall dissimilarity between hunter-gatherer. Mimbres, and Caddo samples suggests that each may have arisen from a relatively distant common ancestry.","source":"Scopus","title":"Biological relationships between foragers and farmers of South-Central North America: Nonmetric dental traits","volume":"77","page start":"99","author(s) id":"7406240864;26035656000;","document type":"Article","root":"true","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","pr_domain":"0.0","authors":"Taylor M., Creel D.","doi":"10.7183/0002-7316.77.1.99"},"color":"rgb(102,0,9)","size":2.0},{"label":"Rohlf F.J., Slice D.","x":138.78273010253906,"y":348.1399230957031,"id":"1444","attributes":{"funding details":"National Science Foundation, NSF: BSR 8306004, BSR 8318792","eid":"2-s2.0-84860428591","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.013986013986013986","year":"1990","page end":"59","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84860428591\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f2992207\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d74ce7a85fe27c8da218b0b8e0fbb6d49","source title":"Systematic Zoology","abstract":"Superimposition methods for comparing configurations of landmarks in two or more specimens are reviewed.
