One such group is associated with sites along the Mississippi River and its western tributaries, a second is associated with sites on the Appalachian Rim in Tennessee, a third is associated with sites on the Piedmont and associated drainages, and a fourth is associated with sites in Alabama. This pattern reflects the existence of several large, clay-mineral provinces in the Southeast that now can be recognized as sources in future studies of long-distance exchange.

This study focuses on element-based provenance studies of Mississippian-period pottery, which are complicated by the fact that this pottery generally was tempered with crushed shell in different amounts and of unknown species composition. Experiments conducted at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) have documented elemental dilution and enhancement effects of adding shell temper to clay. Mathematical corrections previously have been employed to correct for shell-temper effects. Results of physical, chemical, and mathematical approaches to eliminating the effects of shell tempering indicate that mathematical methods, based on a firm knowledge of shell composition, provide the most efficient correction.

Complicating factors include dealing with temper and amassing background data from potential source areas. Because freshwater mussels incorporate elements into their shells in proportion to the chemical makeup of waterways, hypothetically the drainage of origin could be determined for shell-tempered pottery by chemically analyzing the temper particles. A chemical analysis of whole-shell samples is presented which indicates that separation by drainage is possible. Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) provides a rapid, precise, and essentially nondestructive way to analyze shell-temper particles without having to remove them from the sherd. A pilot study employing LA-ICP-MS on shell-tempered ceramics from Lyon's Bluff (22OK520), a late prehistoric/Protohistoric period site in northeast Mississippi, suggests that while some stylistically exotic artifacts appear to be imports, others appear to have been made locally. These results, although preliminary in terms of sourcing ceramics from the site, are useful in introducing the method and for discussing procedural considerations arising from the study.",,"archaeological evidence; artifact; ceramics; chemical composition; inductively coupled plasma method; prehistoric; provenance; Mississippi; North America; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-39549084540

A.D. 1300. This was at least one or two centuries after it became the dominant temper used by aboriginal groups in much of the Eastern Woodlands but generally contemporaneous with shelltempered usage in parts of the Southern Plains. The introduction of shell temper was variable across the Caddo area, and in certain regions its use was negligible in ceramic vessel assemblages until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but then was rapidly adopted as the dominant temper employed in vessel manufacture, particularly for utility wares. In the traditional territory of the historic Hasinai Caddo in East Texas, shell temper did not appear in vessels until the early eighteenth century, and then only in minor amounts on presumed trade vessels.",,"ceramics; cultural tradition; eighteenth century; historical perspective; indigenous population; manufacturing; material culture; seventeenth century; shell; trade; vessel; Texas; United States",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857571592
