Archaeological data and documentary accounts illuminate this relationship and demonstrate a widespread cognitive lore about the marking of the seasons by use of the sun and possibly other celestial bodies. The apparent timing of pre-contact mortuary ceremonialism with the winter solstice sunset consistent with Caddoan winter death imagery reflects a local manifestation of the North American Orpheus myth.",,"archaeology; cultural history; cultural tradition; documentary source",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750598922

Even within this one shared architectural tradition there are three geographically distinct patterns in the shape of the specialized buildings and the orientation of their extended entranceways. These geographic differences may reflect the existence of diverse Caddo beliefs on mortuary rituals and cosmological symbolism as well as site-specific decisions on the place of specialized buildings within living communities.",,"archaeology; building; cultural tradition; symbolism; North America; Ozark Mountains; Texas; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69549126885
