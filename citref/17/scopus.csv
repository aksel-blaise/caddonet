The architecture at these two sites is compared with other excavated examples dating to the A.D. 1100s through early 1600s in the Middle Ouachita River, Little Missouri River, and Ouachita Mountains regions. The termination of important buildings through burning and intentional burying is contrasted with the abandonment of ordinary structures, and the meaning of the architectural variation is explored in terms of Caddo ritual and belief systems.",,"archaeology; architectural design; building; cultural history; Holocene; Arkansas; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649329263
