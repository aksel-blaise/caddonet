As opposed to ordinary, unconstrained cluster analysis, only stratigraphically adjacent clusters are considered for merging. The method of incremental sum of squares has been used widely for unconstrained analyses and has proved particularly satisfactory for pollen frequency data. CONISS is a FORTRAN 77 program for stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis by this method. Several data transformations lead to different implicit dissimilarity coefficients. As an option, the program also will perform an unconstrained analysis, which can be useful for comparison with the constrained analysis. © 1987.","Biostratigraphy; Cluster analysis; Stratigraphic zones; Stratigraphically constrained cluster analysis","COMPUTER PROGRAMMING - Algorithms; COMPUTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES - FORTRAN; COMPUTER PROGRAMS; COMPUTER SIMULATION - Mathematical Models; BIOSTRATIGRAPHY; CONISS PROGRAMS; INCREMENTAL SUM OF SQUARES; STRATIGRAPHIC ZONES; STRATIGRAPHICALLY CONSTRAINED CLUSTER ANALYSIS; GEOLOGY","University of Minnesota, UM

Contoured isopoll maps of arboreal pollen percentages (%AP) are based upon 1684 surface samples distributed across the region from 25o to 60oN latitude and from 50o to 105oW longitude. Includes paired maps for the following dominant, subdominant and common tree taxa: Abies, Acer, Betula, Carya, Celtis, Cupressaceae plus Taxodiaceae, Fagus grandifolia, Fraxinus, Ilex, Juglans, Larix laricina, Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron tulipifera, Magnolia, Nyssa, Picea, Pinus, Platanus occidentalis, Populus, Quercus, Salix, Tilia, Tsuga, and Ulmus. Supplemental maps for growing stock volume are included for Chamaecyparis thyoides, Juniperus, Taxodium distichum, Thuja occidentalis, Diploxylon Pinus, Haploxylon Pinus, hard maples and soft maples. Scatter plots of growing stock volume (%GSV) versus %AP illustrate the relationships of dominance in the vegetation to pollen production and dispersal for 20 important tree taxa. Geometric-mean linear regression of positive data pairs of %GSV and %AP yields slope and intercept parameters that are used to quantify modern pollen-vegetation relationships. These major vegetation and pollen data sets and calibrations provide the foundation for the use of modern analog and taxon calibration approaches for quantification of Late Quaternary vegetational history in eastern North America.-from Authors",,"Abies; Acer; Betula; Carya; Celtis; Chamaecyparis thyoides; Cupressaceae; Fagus grandifolia; Fraxinus; Ilex; Juglans; Juniperus; Larix laricina; Liquidambar styraciflua; Liriodendron tulipifera; Magnolia; Nyssa; Picea; Pinus; Platanus occidentalis; Populus; Quercus; Salix; Taxodiaceae; Taxodium distichum; Thuja occidentalis; Tilia; Tsuga; Ulmus",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058674727

This paper presents the results of a dedicated monitoring programme conducted over 2 years and at a catchment scale in South West England. The land use of the nine sub-catchments monitored was determined using Landsat Thematic Data. At two stations, pollen and spore sampling through storm hydrographs was undertaken whilst at the other 7 sub-catchments only peak flow samples were collected. Samples were also collected from re-suspended bed material, riverbanks and at low flows. Airborne pollen flux was monitored using modified Tauber traps. The results support previous research illustrating how the vast majority of fluvial pollen and spores are transported during floods (in this case 91%) and that the main control on waterborne pollen and spore assemblages is the catchment vegetation. However, strong seasonal effects are shown as well as the importance of distinctive sources, such as the riparian input, bed re-suspension and overland flow into drains and tributaries. Fine sediment in river pools appears to act as a selective store of damaged cereal-type pollen grains in arable catchments and this can reduce the inherent underestimate of arable land from pollen diagrams with a high fluvial input and increase the visibility of early agriculture. In order to simulate the likely result of a flood-dominated influx to a small lake scenario, modelling was undertaken whereby different sub-catchments were substituted in order to represent changes in catchment vegetation under a constant hydrological regime. The results show the dampened response of land use groups to catchment land use change, and the frequent occurrence of anomalous single-level peaks due to seasonal flushes from specific near-stream vegetation types. Both these features are commonly seen in lake pollen diagrams. Fluvial pollen and spore loading is dependant upon discharge and so concentrations in laminated or varved sediments could be regarded as a proxy for flood magnitude. The implications for this study on the interpretation of lake and near-shore marine pollen and spore diagrams are discussed and it is argued that a more quantitative approach to waterborne pollen could improve the estimation of land use from lakes in the temperate zone. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Differential transport (sorting) of different taxa has been shown to occur. From the results it is possible to estimate the flow velocity above which sorting does not occur. The nature of the bed material, over which the current passes, is also shown to have considerable effect on deposition rates. Problems encountered in the flume experiments led to a field study at Silwood Lake, England, treating the lake currents as an extended flume with its own spore/pollen supply. Results from this lake study also show the effect of differential transport.

That question can best be addressed by first documenting the dynamics of changing ""wet"" cycles during the Holocene in the central Mexican region between the northern limits of Pre-Hispanic agriculture and its southern margins in northwestern Chihuahua. Consequently the Laguna Project targeted a 125,000 km2 sector of North-Central Mexico, 250 km from north to south and 500 km from east to west, from Saltillo to Durango. Some 40 sedimentary profiles with multiple cumulic soils were studied in the field and laboratory, supported by 163 conventional 14C and AMS dates on charcoal and soil humates. We distinguish: (1) wet floodplains (with humic paleosols, redox phenomena reflecting high water tables, channel-ponding sequences, and interbedded tufas) that imply aquifer recharge, sustained base flow, and mainly low-energy conditions; and (2) high-energy pulses of discharge that mobilized cobble gravels or forced channel entrenchment (""gullying"") and were tied to episodic, excessive rains that promoted valley and slope instability. In between such ""wet"" cycles and recurrent disequilibrium events, climate was similar to today, probably less humid, with limited geomorphologic change or slow soil formation. ""Wet"" cycles were rare at the end of the Pleistocene, but prominent during the Holocene. Disequilibrium proxies became common and dramatic after 2500 BP. The drainages from the Eastern and Western Sierra Madres responded in phase, but varied in detail. Around AD 1050-1200 ""natural"" erosion led to loss of soil organic carbon, as alternating severe droughts and heavy rains destroyed the ground cover and led to ecological aridification, well before arrival of Spanish miners and settlers. The evidence that human activity triggered Pre-Hispanic or Colonial erosion in Central Mexico should therefore be re-evaluated. Global comparisons and interpretations are discussed, but with caution, since no single theory can explain the whole of the record. The soil-geomorphology geoarchive of North-Central Mexico primarily is an environmental history of alternating ""wet"" cycles, rather than of sustained wet or dry climates. The critical differences between ""soaking"" and ""excessive"" rains, with their respective impacts, may be due to switching between winter and summer storm categories. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Stratigraphic pollen data derived are employed towards a reconstruction of the history of the regional pine-hardwood forest from 3500 cal. BP until present. This bio-stratigraphic sequence demonstrates that the valley has remained almost completely under forest canopy during the Middle and Late Holocene, when it is comprised of a mixture of oak, pine, and hickory. During the past 3500 yrs, the relative importance of these taxa has also varied due to drought and fire. In this respect, a differential (riparian) representation by moisture-sensitive river birch in the pollen sequence strongly suggests that periodic droughts in the valley have caused a secular variation in fire frequency and magnitude. Finally, during the past 800 yrs (Caddo period), the first significant grasslands and forbs emerge in forest clearings. The latter emergent formations are of possible anthropogenic origin after pollen data. © Southern Appalachian Botanical Society.",,"Betula nigra; Carya",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649236497
