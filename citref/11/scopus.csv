These floral changes include most importantly a long-term decline of hickory and a rise of pine due to physiographic factors of irreversible soil acidification. With a view to factors of climate change, a major xeric phase is defined between 4000 and 3000 BP, when grassland vegetation expands beyond its present range. Human impacts during the prehistoric period are comparatively limited despite a regional presence of many archaeological sites, although tentative evidence for a Native sylviculture of hickory is considered. Methods of alluvial palynology pioneered in East Texas are validated through an application of strict checks on palynological data sets. © 2011 Southern Appalachian Botanical Society.",,"acidification; alluvial deposit; anthropogenic effect; archaeology; climate variation; coniferous tree; core analysis; data set; deciduous tree; grassland; Holocene; paleoclimate; paleoecology; palynology; prehistoric; silviculture; vegetation dynamics; Anderson County [Texas]; Texas; United States; Carya",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960509773
