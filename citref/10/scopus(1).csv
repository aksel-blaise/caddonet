We know that Cahokia was the center of production for large flint clay figurines and effigy pipes (Emerson and Hughes 2000). Similar Cahokia-style figures have been found in the Trans-Mississippi South and the Southeast. We investigated the material used to make these figures using a newly developed nondestructive PIMA SP™ spectroscopic technology to identify the stone and to determine their source location. These analyses proved that the figures were made of Missouri flint clay from quarries near St. Louis. We submit that Cahokia was the twelfth-century source for the production of these Cahokia-style figures. Outside of Cahokia the flint clay figures were primarily found in Caddoan mortuaries, reinforcing earlier evidence of a strong Cahokia-Caddoan connection. The available chronological and contextual information indicates the flint clay figures left Cahokia after it began to decline in the late thirteenth-century, through various mechanisms of extra-local exchange rather than as part of any systematic prestige-goods network. The association of these highly symbolic figures with Cahokia allows us to reevaluate the indigenous iconography and propose that many of the themes (e.g., fertility and warfare) that later appear in Eastern Woodlands native cosmology such as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex were first codified here in the twelfth-century.

Images of this bird have given rise to more interpretive interest than perhaps any other (e.g., Brown 1975, Emerson 1997, Strong 1989). However, the scope of that interest has remained limited to traits intrinsic to the living hawk. Missing is serious consideration of ideological associations independent of the bird's biological or ecological attributes. It is these ideological associations that connect importantly with Mississippian Period political economy. We need not look far to find a rich source of culturally constructed meanings. A particularly useful case comes from the Osage of the Prairie Plains, where the sacred Wa-xobe is the ""symbolic hawk."" This hawk or falcon is simultaneously an avatar of warriors in combat and an object for supplication, not merely to ensure success or failure on the field of battle, but more essentially to ensure a lengthy life, a healthy family, and a long line of descendants (La Flesche 1939: 9-13, 85-86). As reinforcement for this symbolic bird's less-than-obvious significance, its origin is placed supernaturally in the sky among a pantheon of the sun, the moon, and four stars (La Flesche 1921: 63, 1930: 603). There is nothing intrinsic about these heavenly connections. Nor are they arbitrary; rather, these associations are an essential part of a carefully articulated cosmology. For humans the hawk is a symbolic source of supernatural gifts of health, longevity, and a long line of descendants. The bird is merely an exemplar of the theme, not the theme itself. What follows is an attempt to transport the ideological essentials of the falcon theme of recent, post-contact time back six hundred to seven hundred years earlier, to a seminal period in the history of Cahokia when the falcon imagery found elaborate figural expression. The burden of the iconographic argument is to stress the logical durability of the falcon theme as a charter for key social statuses in a range of different political economies. Signature characteristics of the theme are its association of life's chances with high-stakes gaming, the triumphant return of life with the pre-dawn appearance of the morning star, and the flight of the arrow as a metaphor for the succession of generations into the future. All or a combination of these constitute essential features of the theme in Southeastern myth. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

Even if the area is reduced to its presumed major centers for diffusion, such as Spiro, Moundville, and Etowah/Tennessee Valley, it still seems certain that the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex was international in nature, encompassing groups speaking different languages and manifesting somewhat different cultural traditions. The sharing of a visual symbol system such as the SECC suggests the sharing of some sort of belief system which lies behind and is manifest in the iconography. Such a belief system, like the iconography, must be beyond the boundaries of culture and the particulars of environmental adaptation. Ethnographic evidence from various groups across several centuries provides many clues to such similarities in beliefs, and the clearest focus for such commonalities is the structure of the cosmos. The belief that the world is layered appears to be universal across the Woodlands and Plains. That layered cosmos is inhabited by a fairly small number of Powers, most of whom are recognizable as they shift their forms and meanings from one group to another. Both the structural elements of the cosmos and the Powers which inhabit it, furthermore, have qualitative meanings, as is to be expected in a religious belief system. None of these insights is new, of course, but it is important to recall that the basic beliefs of an ancient North American international religion are already known, at least in the forms in which they yet survive. Thus an attempt to match some of them to an international iconographic system is not so great a conceptual leap, and, in fact, has been done before. This chapter is a consideration of the elements comprising a generalized cosmological model from the Woodlands and Plains, into which is incorporated an explication of iconographic elements that appear to be visual expressions of the beliefs. The crucial cosmological information is contained in mythology, in statements of belief, and in descriptions of ritual, all gathered through the last few centuries by ethnographers of varying trustworthiness. It is the argument of this chapter that in light of the knowledge of the cosmological beliefs of Native America, which is greater than is generally thought, these iconographic images are not as obscure as the visual presentation alone makes them seem. While the interpretations cannot be proved - what would constitute ""proof"" in iconographic study? - it is possible to present a strong case for them. This study seeks to identify some of the basic structural motifs of cosmology in the SECC images, as well as some of the nonhuman characters who inhabit that cosmos. Such a project could very quickly get out of hand, given the large number of images and visual motifs that are contained in the SECC, and it thus seems wise to limit the present demonstration to the interpretation of a few basic images. Therefore, two shell gorget designs will be the focus of this investigation, each of them found in a long series in the Tennessee River Valley and Etowah. They are known by type names assigned in this century on the basis of similarity of design. One, which has twenty-three known examples, is called the Cox Mound style (Fig. 2.1 [left]). The other, found in thirty examples, is called the Hixon style (Fig. 2.1 [right]) (Brain and Phillips 1996: 9-15). Interpreting these gorgets should take place on at least two levels. The focus in this chapter is on ideological content - to what empirical or conceptual realities do the elements of the designs refer? The second level, which is beyond the limits of the present chapter, is that of functional meaning - to what social uses are these iconographic images put? Who wears these gorgets, and what do they say about the wearer? The difference between the two realms of interpretation is important, because it is difficult to claim that a symbol has been exegeted properly until both realms have been explored. An analogous situation from Western history is the case of the Christian cross - an explanation of it in terms of the New Testament story of the crucifixion and its ramifications is an interpretation of the first type. There is, however, the meaning of the different forms of the cross (Maltese, St. Andrews, and so on) as signifiers of religious orders or national traditions, as well as the meaning of crosses as parts of personal insignia (rank in an order or priesthood, participation in a Crusade, and so on) - a set of interpretations which go far beyond the conceptual meaning of a religious philosophy. It seems fair to consider that engraved shell designs such as the Cox Mound style and the Hixon style, because they are represented in multiple forms and found in situ in graves as costume elements, should be examined from this twofold perspective of conceptual and functional meaning. Unfortunately, the brevity of this article limits the interpretation to the first realm only. The theses of this chapter can be listed briefly: (1) the two gorget styles are cosmological models, one a view from above, the other a side view; (2) both of the symbols and the field they occupy have meanings related to the believed structure of the cosmos and the cultural practices of the societies which created the images; and (3) those meanings, at least in the limited denotative sense described above, can be understood from beliefs, myths, and practices known from many different societies across the Eastern Woodlands and Plains, and they can be plausibly linked to the iconographic symbols. In order to present the support for these arguments, this chapter analyzes each of the two gorget styles in turn, with excursi into the ethnographic material at several points to bring into the discussion relevant religious understandings. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

The image takes several forms, but the U-shaped serpent with horns and peculiar wings was apparently particularly important at Moundville. In the only published inventory of Moundville ceramics, the winged serpent is the most numerous design (thirty-three examples), rivaled only by the hand-and-eye design (thirty-one examples) (Steponaitis 1983). This preponderance is confirmed by another scholar from his own studies of Moundville ceramics (V. J. Knight, Jr., personal communication, 1996). Other examples of the same design have been found in the ceramic collections in the Central Mississippi Valley near Memphis (Childs 1991; David Dye, personal communication, 1996). There are other forms of the winged serpent (and its variants) known from Spiro. The Moundville design, however, will serve as the particular focus for this study. The major argument is that the winged serpent is a well-known mythological figure from the religious worldview of the Eastern Woodlands and that the wings, rather than being a part of the essential form of the creature, are an indicator of location in the celestial realm. To lay out this argument, it will be necessary to survey the lore surrounding the horned serpent and look at the relevant ethnoastronomy, which is not well known for the Eastern Woodlands. The astronomical orientation of Pawnee mythology and ritual has long been recognized, but there are indications that other peoples of the Eastern Woodlands and Plains also encoded astronomical lore in their myths (Chamberlain 1982; Williamson and Farrer 1990). That wider distribution, however, may have been more than random occurrences of ethnoastronomical beliefs. This chapter and Chapter 8 argue that a set of astronomical beliefs encoded in myths and iconography constituted a symbolic complex which in earlier centuries was widely known in North America. Further, the cross-cultural nature of this belief complex was probably due to the fact that it was rooted in an even more widely accepted cosmology (see Chapter 2). For people who believe that the cosmos is basically a layer cake of worlds, the relation of the layers to each other becomes an important cosmological concern. Among the various Native American groups in the Eastern Woodlands and the Plains, those layers became identified with particular powers, enabling discussion of the relationships to take on mythic form with various ""persons"" interacting with each other in the various eras of mythic time. That mythic identification also permits the casting of structural principles in terms of the types of relationship in which each person participates. One of the primary mythological principles is the opposition of the forces of day and night. The diurnal opposition becomes expressed as tension between the powers of the celestial vault and the powers of the waters and caverns beneath the earth-disk. Central to this cosmology is the prior existence of the primeval water, which is separated from the Above World only by a deliberate act of creation - the earth, which is made to float upon the water. The primeval water is not a neutral backdrop for human life in this scheme, for it is the domain of many different species, both those which are recognized in modern science and those which are far more powerful - mythological creatures who rule the water world. As is customary in Native American myths, those water powers were prevalent and visible in primordial times, but even in modern times they are occasionally seen by humans - but only if they wish to be seen. ""These manitous often come upon earth and pass among the people; they are not always visible to the eyes of everybody"" (Jones 1911: 214). More frequently, only their works are seen, and their presence is simply supplied by the common worldview. When they do take visible form, they are described in different ways. In a variety of myths there are references to a giant fish, but while there are hints that this form was of considerable importance in former times, it is difficult to make much more of it now than just to acknowledge its existence. A more important image in the central Woodlands and the Plains is the Underwater Panther, and there are graphic illustrations of a panther, probably cognate with that figure, which come from at least as far back as Hopewellian times. The most widely recognized form of the underwater powers, however, is the Horned Water Serpent. It is frequently referred to as a single creature, but more careful reading through the collections indicates that the Underwater Panther/Horned Water Serpent is really understood to be a race of people, representatives of which may be encountered in any large body of water, whether seas, lakes, or rivers. Even so, there is still frequent reference to a ""master"" of the underwater powers. (See Emerson 1989 for an excellent study of this figure in relation to Cahokia.) The Indians say that this earth has four layers. The bottom layer does not look like the one we are on now. It is night there all the time. That is where the manitou is who is the boss that rules the bottom of the earth. He rules all four layers⋯ (Barnouw 1977: 41) It is this ""boss"" of the Beneath World who is the subject of this chapter. Since each of the specific labels - Underwater Panther, Horned Water Serpent - points to a particular visual form, this chapter will use the convention of ""Great Serpent"" whenever the subject is the total concept, regardless of form. This study will first sample the range of descriptive opinion about this figure, in regard both to appearance and function, then attempt to place it in a larger cos-mological context that will help interpret various expressions of this concept, both mythic and iconographic. The basic argument is threefold: (1) the Great Serpent was a universally known figure in the Eastern Woodlands for many centuries, despite its many forms; (2) the Great Serpent was located not only in the water world, but also in the celestial realm; and (3) the Great Serpent appears not only in myth, but also in graphic designs, both prehistoric and historic. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

The Moundville appearances of the interregional distribution of SECC images are useful for analysis because they are part of a large local collection which has been well studied and can thus be quantified (Steponaitis 1983). An examination of the Moundville SECC imagery reveals five images that seem to be closely related - hand-and-eye, skull, bone, winged serpent, and raptor (Fig. 8.1). Of the five motifs, the winged serpent and the hand-and-eye appear most frequently. In Steponaitis's catalog they are listed thirty-three and thirty-one times, respectively. The hand-and-eye motif appears to be the connector for the cluster, appearing in connection with all of the other motifs. On twenty vessels it is found alone; on seven it appears with bones; and on two it has a skull with it. The hand-and-eye motif also appears once with a raptor head and once with a winged serpent, but the raptor is alone in its other eleven showings, and the winged serpent stands alone on its other thirty-two bottles. Finally, the skull and bone appear together on three vessels. Neither the skull nor the bone ever appears alone on the ceramics at Moundville, according to Steponaitis's listing (Steponaitis 1983). This cluster of five motifs thus is distinctive in the Moundville iconographic corpus, for it has no other associations. Each of the motifs stands alone or in association with one of the other four. They appear together, but they do not appear randomly in conjunction with the many other images of the SECC. That pattern suggests that the five images are related - hand-and-eye, skull, bones, raptor, and winged serpent belong together in a single iconographic complex. This discrete grouping of five SECC images is the focus of this chapter. Although the evidence is complicated, the argument is simple: the artistic cluster illustrates a complex of beliefs regarding the death of human beings. The mortuary belief complex in question manifests variation in ethnographic details from one tribal group to another, as might be expected, but there is a unifying metaphor which argues for a common core of belief across the Eastern Woodlands and Plains, and probably far beyond that area. That unifying notion is an understanding of the Milky Way as the path on which the souls of the deceased must walk. Demonstrating this interpretation of the iconographic cluster is a complicated problem, for it involves analyzing ethnographic notes and myth texts from a large geographical area, coupled with ethnoastronomical considerations, to produce a synthetic model of the Path of Souls belief complex. That model must then be matched with the iconographic cluster to offer plausible meanings for the images as they were used in the art of Moundville and other SECC sites. What will be offered here is a generalized model of the Path of Souls complex, with examples of the SECC iconographic images from Moundville as they might have fit into the overall mortuary belief pattern. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

The beads, previously identified as Olivella nivea, are important because O. dama originates in the Gulf of California while O. nivea is from the Gulf of Mexico. An overview of Olivella beads from Plains sites reveals a mixture of shell beads originating from the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of California. The presence of western Olivella beads at Spiro and other Plains sites supports an intensification of trade between Puebloan and Plains peoples during Late Prehistoric times at about A.D. 1400 or slightly earlier, but there is no evidence for strong cultural ties to the west. Olivella beads occur at sites east of the Mississippi River, and these need to be identified to determine coast of origin. © 2002 by the Society for American Archaeology.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141811421

Moore reprint series that covers archaeological discoveries along North American Waterways. Clarence B. Moore (1852-1936), a wealthy Philadelphia socialite, paper company heir, and photographer, made the archaeology of the Southeast his passion. Beginning in the 1870s, Moore systematically explored prehistoric sites along the major waterways of the region, from the Ohio River south to Florida and as far west as Texas, publishing his findings, at his own expense, with the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This volume, the final in a series of nine, includes Moore's investigations along waterways of Arkansas and Louisiana-the Ouachita, Red, Saline, Black, Tensas, and Atchafalaya Rivers-in three complete field sessions ending in 1909, 1912, and 1913. He located and mapped more than 185 mounds and cemeteries. Artifacts recovered in this territory, such as ceramic effigy pots, earthenware pipes, arrowheads, celts, and projectile points, include some of the most important ones discovered by Moore in his 47 years of excavating. Included in this volume is a CD containing the 69 color illustrations from all the original expedition volumes. The elaborate earthwork of Poverty Point, located in West Carroll Parish, Louisiana, is perhaps the most remarkable archaeological site presented in the volume. In some cases, Moore documented sites along the tributaries that have since been destroyed by river action or looters. In other cases, the National Register of Historic Sites and concerned landowners in Arkansas and Louisiana have preserved the record of aboriginal peoples and their life ways that was first illuminated by Moore's sophisticated study. © 2003 by The University of Alabama Press.

The concept' which has its roots in the intensely productive decade of the 1930s' has a history that is both as long as and fundamentally tied to yet another venerable concept in southeastern archaeology: Mississippian. In 1984' as it is today' it was clear that our understanding of the objects' themes' and artistic styles associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) has changed a great deal' and it is equally clear that this complex is much more complex than once thought. Since the publishing of The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex: Artifacts and Analysis' new primary data have come to light that bear directly on the complex' and new theoretical approaches have continued to ask us to view it in new ways. Also in that time' Jeffrey P. Brain and Philip Phillips (1996) published a major work on engraved shell gorget styles' which has reignited many debates about the dating and nature of the SECC and reinvigorated studies of the complex. Given the circumstances' the contributors to this volume saw that the time was right to bring together and present these new data and perspectives on the SECC. The purpose here is not to present a single' unified conception of the SECC but rather to present new data and new ideas on the temporal and social contexts of the objects' artistic styles' and symbolic themes included in the complex. In fact' it will become clear that there is no single' unified perspective on the meaning' function' or content of the SECC precisely because the SECC was not a single' monolithic ceremonial complex' artistic tradition' or belief system. Despite this' for simplicity's sake I will continue to refer to this complex as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or SECC. The purpose of this chapter is to create a context for the contributions that follow by briefl y reviewing the development of our conceptions of the SECC and the research that it has engendered. I organize this review around a series of publications that I consider to be watershed contributions in the history of the SECC. The reader is referred to Brown (2001a)' Brown and Kelly (2000)' Galloway (1989)' and Williams (1968) for other fine reviews of the development of the SECC.
