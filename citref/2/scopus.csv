Davis sites. Results indicate a significant difference in Gahagan biface morphology at the Mounds Plantation site when compared with Gahagan bifaces from the Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis sites. Tests for allometry and asymmetry were not significant. The test of morphological disparity indicates that Gahagan bifaces produced at the Mounds Plantation site occupy a more restricted range of morphospace than those produced at Gahagan Mound, providing indirect evidence for standardisation and diversity in Caddo biface production. While the sample includes a wide range of variation in biface shapes, the test of morphological integration indicates that Gahagan bifaces are significantly integrated, meaning that those traits used to characterise their shape (blade and base) vary in a coordinated manner. These results articulate with a shift in Caddo bottle morphology over the same geography, potentially indicating two previously unrecognised and morphologically-distinct lithic and ceramic production areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D; American Southeast; Caddo; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological disparity; Morphological integration; Virtual archaeology",,,"We extend our gratitude to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, Northwestern State University (Williamson Museum), the Louisiana State Exhibit Museum, and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory for the requisite permissions and access needed to generate the 3D scans of the Gahagan bifaces.
