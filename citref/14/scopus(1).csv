In this paper, the history of the use of geophysical techniques in archaeology will be discussed, as will significant research themes associated with the most widely used prospecting devices. It is apparent that while the use of geophysical techniques is at an all-time high, there are many key areas where prospecting is rapidly developing. Some of the advances relate to fundamental aspects of the techniques, while others dictate how we undertake survey in the future. There is a movement away from pre-gridded survey areas towards real-time GPS for navigation. This allows greater integration, or fusion, of disparate data sources using visualization techniques derived from associated disciplines. The analysis of landscapes has become a major component of the application of new technology and there are many challenges to be tackled, including how to analyse and interpret significant archaeology within large-scale, data-rich, multi-technique investigations. The reflective nature of the review acknowledges the important role of Archaeometry in the development of archaeological geophysics. © University of Oxford, 2008.","Earth resistance; Electromagnetic; GPR; GPS; Landscape; Magnetometry; Resistivity; Visualization","archaeology; detection method; electrical resistivity; geophysical survey; GPS; ground penetrating radar; landscape; magnetometer; real time; visualization",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149176574

It is shown through a series of case studies from two regions in North America that archaeo-geophysical surveys can produce primary information suitable for the study of site content, structure and organization, for examining spatial patterns and relationships, and for directly confronting specific questions about a site and the past. Because large buried cultural landscapes can now be revealed, it is argued that an alternative perspective on regional or landscape archaeology may be possible because space can be viewed in terms of tens of hectares as opposed to the lens of square meters typical of archaeological excavations. Moreover, by placing focus on such buried features as dwellings, storage facilities, public structures, middens, fortifications, trails, or garden spaces that are not commonly revealed through most contemporary surface inspection methods, a richer view of archaeology, the past, and cultural landscapes can be achieved. Archaeo-geophysical suneys can also play an important role in Cultural Resource Management (CRM) contexts as feature discovery tools for focusing expensive excavations, thereby reducing the amount needed and lowering costs. Their utility is weighed against shovel test pits as a primitive and costly form of prospecting. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeoli.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645082412

Recent remote sensing work at the Hill Farm site (41BW169) on the Red River in northeast Texas, along with available archaeological information from the shallowly buried site, has led to an unusually detailed view of the archaeological character of ca. A.D. 1600-1700 Nasoni Caddo village compounds that can be linked with the 1691 Teran map. Remote sensing has considerable potential to lead to long-term collaborative archaeogeophysical and archaeological projects to understand Caddo community-scale organization and landscapes.",,"archaeological evidence; archaeology; documentary source; mapping; remote sensing; North America; Red River [United States]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349096942

Using these methods, a large-scale magnetic gradiometry survey at the Battle Mound site (3LA1), a premier Middle and Late Caddo mound site located in the Red River Great Bend region, produced an informative archaeogeophysical data set of numerous anomalies that can be attributed to both archaeological and geological sources. Findings include convincing evidence for burned rectangular and circular structures, a possible community cemetery, a farmstead with a compound fence, the extent of an historic occupation, and natural phenomena that include lighting strikes and palaeochannels of the Red River. The magnetic gradiometry survey not only has demonstrated the usefulness of archaeogeophysics as a primary data set in archaeological interpretation but also has provided a unique data set regarding the cultural and natural history at the Battle Mound site.",,"archaeology; cultural history; Holocene; settlement pattern; Red River [United States]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649309555

To date, the Texas Historical Commission has surveyed 40 sites from various time periods and geographical settings in Texas. The cart has allowed rapid surveys over large areas while minimizing signal-degrading noise. Four examples from Texas show that large-area and high-density magnetic surveys can be completed in relatively short periods of time producing maps that aid significantly in archaeological site interpretation. In some instances, no field excavation was required to understand quickly what the magnetic patterns represented in terms of buried archaeological features. In all cases, the magnetometer maps provided important information to help guide future field excavations.",,,,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-61949099314
