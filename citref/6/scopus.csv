In total, 13 discrete ""salt licks"" were visited at these salt domes. The results of this survey indicate that along with Potter's Pond, the Drake's Salt Works Site Complex was one of northwestern Louisiana 's most intensively utilized salines during the protohistoric and early historic periods. It is argued here that salt production in this area developed largely in response to an increased demand for salt and salttreated commodities following European contact. Although numerous salt licks would have been known to the Caddo, only a fraction of these licks were involved in salt making. While there were likely many factors involved in determining which licks were favored over others, the availability and strength of liquid brine, resistance to flooding, fuel availability, and proximity to European traders would have been several important considerations.",,"archaeology; brine; commodity; prehistoric; salt dome; Louisiana; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906691593
