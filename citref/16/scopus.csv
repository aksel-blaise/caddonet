A.D. 1200-1680) mound site. Using these methods, a 1-ha (2.47 acres) area directly east of the large mound ivas surveyed using magnetic gradiometry and concatenated to the existing survey area. Results from the 1-ha survey provide further elucidation of the spatial structure and internal organization of the Caddo Indian occupation at the Battle Mound site.",,"archaeology; geographical research; geophysical method; settlement pattern; Arkansas; Lafayette County [Arkansas]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951918108
