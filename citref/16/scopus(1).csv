This record of human occupation varies with the alluvial style of the river, resulting in each river valley having a unique archeological record controlled by three factors; location of occupation sites, preservation of those sites, and recognition of the sites. If problems of site preservation and recognition in a river valley can be recognized and addressed, a better insight into settlement patterns and complex human-environment interactions can result. This study represents a synthesis of extensive published and secondary data sets pertaining to archaeology and alluvial geomorphology of the lower Missouri, Red, and Mississippi Rivers, to examine the relationship of prehistoric site distribution with fluvial geomorphology. The archeologic data are from published literature and government agencies. The geomorphic data are from a variety of published and unpublished investigations, including maps of alluvial geomorphology, digital elevation models, aerial photographs, and topographic maps. The data were input into spreadsheets and a GIS for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Prehistoric human occupation of the narrow Missouri valley floor is limited, with only 0.061 recorded sites/km2. Additional sites are likely buried by thick vertical accretion sediment on the limited prehistoric portions of the floodplain and within alluvial/colluvial fans along the valley margin. Non-random preservation patterns, such as the absence of sites from the youngest cultural period, are attributed to shifts in settlement patterns. In comparison to the lower Missouri River valley, prehistoric occupation of the lower Red and Mississippi rivers was much more extensive and the density of occupation was 0.274 sites/km2 and 0.277 sites/km2 respectively. Significant differences do exist in the age of sites and their relationship to different floodplain depositional environments. Many sites along the active meander belt of the Red River were likely lost due to high rates of channel migration. Nevertheless, intense occupation of Paleo-Indian through Caddoan groups assures that many significant sites have been preserved. The wide valley and high rates of sedimentation suggest that many sites are likely buried, particularly along natural levees flanking an older meander belt. Recorded sites are also present along streams that incise the terrace, along the terrace margin, and along small channels that cross the backswamp. The spatial and temporal site distribution along the lower Mississippi valley is distinct in comparison with the Red River because the Mississippi valley is wider, the terraces are younger and less dissected, and the floodplain has more relief and is not broadly inundated by floodwater with relatively low sediment concentrations. Most of the significant Archaic through Mississippian period floodplain sites are located along the surfaces of abandoned Mississippi and distributary meander belts which aggraded above the adjacent backswamp and have rarely been influenced by flood sedimentation since abandonment. Abundant Paleo-Indian through Mississippian period sites are also widely distributed across undissected terraces. Only a few significant Mississippian sites are present along the active meander belt and in the backswamp where flooding was common. In comparison with the Red River, the archaeological record of the floodplain is less likely to be influenced by burial or erosion due to the Mississippi River having lower rates of overbank sedimentation and channel migration, respectively. The variable alluvial styles of the lower Missouri River, lower Red River, and the lower Mississippi River valleys presented varying opportunities and constraints to occupation and sustained settlement, and resulted in widely varying archaeological patterns that are partly dependent upon the alluvial geomorphology. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Rejection of the unwanted geomagnetic field and its diurnal variations is accomplished by adopting a gradient magnetometer arrangement in which only the difference signal from two magnetometers, separated by a short distance, is recorded. Nuclear resonance scalar magnetometers offer high sensitivity but have higher power requirements and therefore suffer a weight penalty relative to fluxgate types. Fluxgate magnetometers are vector sensing and their sensitivity is limited, mainly by thermally induced mechanical and electronic drift. This paper describes the development of a 1-m separation, vertical component, fluxgate magnetometer that alleviates these problems. Single and multiple array gradiometer configurations are presented, together with a description of data logging software developed to enhance survey efficiency. Survey data acquired during trials and testing are presented. The ergonomics of portable instrument surveying is also discussed. © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Fluxgate; Gradiometer; Magnetometer",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548716268

Findings include convincing evidence for burned rectangular and circular structures, a possible community cemetery, a farmstead with a compound fence, the extent of an historic occupation, and natural phenomena that include lighting strikes and palaeochannels of the Red River.

Moore reprint series that covers archaeological discoveries along North American Waterways. Clarence B. Moore (1852-1936), a wealthy Philadelphia socialite, paper company heir, and photographer, made the archaeology of the Southeast his passion. Beginning in the 1870s, Moore systematically explored prehistoric sites along the major waterways of the region, from the Ohio River south to Florida and as far west as Texas, publishing his findings, at his own expense, with the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This volume, the final in a series of nine, includes Moore's investigations along waterways of Arkansas and Louisiana-the Ouachita, Red, Saline, Black, Tensas, and Atchafalaya Rivers-in three complete field sessions ending in 1909, 1912, and 1913. He located and mapped more than 185 mounds and cemeteries. Artifacts recovered in this territory, such as ceramic effigy pots, earthenware pipes, arrowheads, celts, and projectile points, include some of the most important ones discovered by Moore in his 47 years of excavating. Included in this volume is a CD containing the 69 color illustrations from all the original expedition volumes. The elaborate earthwork of Poverty Point, located in West Carroll Parish, Louisiana, is perhaps the most remarkable archaeological site presented in the volume. In some cases, Moore documented sites along the tributaries that have since been destroyed by river action or looters. In other cases, the National Register of Historic Sites and concerned landowners in Arkansas and Louisiana have preserved the record of aboriginal peoples and their life ways that was first illuminated by Moore's sophisticated study. © 2003 by The University of Alabama Press.
