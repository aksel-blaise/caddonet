In the middle of this period, people shifted dwellings from pithouses to pueblos, a shift previously viewed as the pivotal transformation of Mimbres society. In this paper we show that significant changes in Mimbres society began in the A.D. 800s. Trends in the construction methods of communal pit structures, the placement of dedicatory items within them, their ritual retirements, and their long-lived significance within Mimbres villages, reflect other changes that occurred in Mimbres society. We contend that in the A.D. 8OOs, rapid change based on strong connections with the Hohokam of southern Arizona and agricultural intensification began a trajectory that culminated in the Classic Mimbres pueblos of the A.D. 1000s and early 1100s. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeology.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-70450040436

Our analysis aims at contributing to the ongoing debate regarding the origin and spread of agriculture in the peninsula by contrasting the dental evidence of archaeological and modern molecular samples. It is not possible to generalize given the complex and dynamic nature of these populations. However, the results from the principal component analysis, maximum likelihood, mean measure of divergence, and multidimensional scaling do indicate a net separation of the Paleo-Mesolithic sample from the other groups that is not related to dental reduction. This suggests that the shift in dental morphology was the product of Neolithic populations migrating into the peninsula from other areas. Nonetheless, the Paleo-Mesolithic populations share several discriminative traits with the Neolithic group. The biological relevance of such evidence suggests that, to some minor extent, the spread of agriculture did not occur by total population replacement. Because of regional small sample sizes, this hypothesis cannot be tested on a micro-regional scale. It is, however, feasible to depict a scenario where processes of genetic mixture or replacement probably took place at different rates on a macro-regional level. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biological affinities; Dental morphology; Italy; Neolithic; Paleo-Mesolithic","agriculture; article; geographic distribution; human; Italy; maximum likelihood method; morphology; paleoanthropology; population dynamics; population research; principal component analysis; tooth; Agriculture; Evolution; Fossils; Geography; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Italy; Tooth",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34250338522

The projectile points became the type ""Midland"" collection. Stratigraphy, radiometric dating, paleontology, and geochemistry suggested that the artifacts and bones dated to at least 10,000 B.P. and that the human remains were possibly as old as 20,000 B.P. The researchers believed that the human bones were from below a red sand that in turn was below a Folsom occupation. The dating of the human remains has long been problematic, however, and recent attempts to apply U-series dating further confuse the story. Geoarchaeological investigations were carried out at the site from 1989 to 1992 to reevahtate the geochronology, with particular reference to the age of the skeletal material. We reach several conclusions: (1) there are two Red Sands; (2) the human remains are from below the upper Red Sand, but the Folsom material is from above the lower Red Sand and, therefore, the Red Sand stratigraphy is not relevant to the age of the human remains; (3) the human remains were associated with the valley-margin facies of a lacustrine carbonate that is well dated in the region and rarely is > 10,000 B.P.; and (4) all numerical dating methods applied at the site produced unreliable results. We find no compelling evidence that the human remains from the Midland site are older than Folsom age; they may be contemporary with or younger than the Folsom occupation.

Discrete dental trait analysis provides a useful means for assessing the degree of genetic relatedness between populations when large comparative samples are available. Both in situ cultural change and population replacement have been posited as the dominant mechanism acting on Basketmaker and early Puebloan groups. We examine the relationship of these populations to probable Uto-Aztecan speakers in light of the Uto-Aztecan farmer migration hypothesis. The Basketmaker II complex, traditionally recognised as a distinct cultural unit, exhibits considerable population heterogeneity. Western Basketmakers appear to share biological ties with Uto-Aztecan speakers, while Eastern Basketmakers do not, as predicted by the model. The relationship of the Mimbres to probable Uto-Aztecan speakers is less clear because the Mimbres show only weak affinities to northern Mexican populations.

Availability of either aquatic or high quality wild plant resources are expected to delay intensification on plants which might lead to agriculture. Hunter-gatherer population models suggest where intensification processes may occur early in prehistoric sequences. These models are compared with archaeological stable isotope and burned rock midden data from Texas which indicate hunter-gatherers on the Texas coastal plain made substantial use of aquatic resources and that burned rock middens likely reflect intensified use of wild plants. The temporal and spatial distribution of these strategies is consistent with the expectations of the models. This approach may have utility for exploring both the absence as well as the presence of agricultural adaptations through time; however, further research on resource distributions and archaeological indicators of intensification are needed.","Agriculture; Aquatic resources; Hunter-gatherer; Intensification; Texas archaeology",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43749094772

Based on the two known sites of this age, the economy was oriented toward the procurement of megafauna such as elephants, camels, horses, and bison, although the earliest kills were probably individuals or pairs of animals that were trapped and slain (Bement 1986). The later Folsom and Plainview hunters had apparently perfected the jump technique of bison hunting, suggesting organizational skills consistent with group procurement strategies that centered upon migratory herd animals (Dibble 1970). The extinction of the large game herds and the onset of a trend toward aridity triggered a transition to Archaic lifeways about ninety-four hundred years ago. The people apparently exploited a broader resource base, developing a reliance on plant products, both as food and as raw material for the burgeoning fiber industry, while retaining established lithic traditions. The transition culminated in a robust adaptation that gives the outward but perhaps misleading impression of great stability for a period of some four thousand years. Rockshelters became the nucleus of the settlement pattern, showing differentiated activity areas of a domestic nature where fiber, wood, bone, and hide were worked, as was the everpresent stone. Mortuary customs included disposal of the dead in convenient vertical shaft caves regardless of age or gender. Then, about fifty-five hundred years ago, the cultural system began a series of internal adjustments, presumably in response to an increasingly arid environment. The end result was the consolidation of traits into the full-blown Archaic expression that defines the Lower Pecos as a distinct cultural entity. A model that parsimoniously explains this development was formulated by analogy to emerging complex societies documented ethnohistorically and archeologically in arid lands around the world. In this model, changes in the distribution of essential resources, most prominently potable water, triggered responses in the settlement pattern and procurement strategies leading to a disproportionate concentration of people along the major rivers. Aridity does not imply a shortage of food, especially if desert succulents increase at the expense of grasslands, but gathering and processing of thorny plant foods and small mammals requires specialized techniques and knowledge. The responsibility for food procurement, especially hunting and gathering in the uplands, would have been delegated to mobile task groups who operated from their bases on the rivers. Diversification broadened the diet to include labor-intensive processing of a wider range of foodstuffs, activities that took place in open camps and rockshelters as well. New methods of social control were mandated by the redistribution of human populations, who were in effect circumscribed by the availability of water. The inevitable tensions introduced by proximity elicited a restructuring of society that was accompanied by the intensification of ritual that was, in turn, manifested by the florescence of publicly produced mural art. A common belief system, rooted in the principles of shamanism and expressed in cave paintings, held sway over the area that is now defined as the Lower Pecos cultural region. This period of time is the apogee of the Lower Pecos cultural trajectory: the consolidation of an ethnic identity that trembled on the verge of societal complexity that was never achieved, possibly for lack of the ability to generate an adequate surplus- the necessary and sufficient condition for sedentism. Sometime around three thousand years ago, the insular Lower Pecos cultural persona relaxed, perhaps disrupted by the advent of new people with a different economic strategy and social structure. A mesic interlude permitted the grasslands of the Great Plains to expand to the Rio Grande, drawing herds of bison and their attendant hunters. Even episodic, perhaps seasonal, influxes of people bearing a fully developed cultural system of their own must have had a perceptible effect on the resident population; at present it can only be discerned in settlement patterns, tool types, and possibly art styles. The return to aridity and the retreat of the grasslands created a vacuum filled by desert-adapted people who came north across the Rio Grande from northern Mexico. Soon, the archeology of the Lower Pecos found affinities with that of central Texas, sharing in the generalized Late Archaic lithic assemblage while perfecting its fiber industry, retaining its characteristic burial customs, and keeping a balance between rockshelters and open camp site occupations. Measures of population density again rise, reaching and exceeding the heights achieved during the Middle Archaic peak, but the processes behind the increase are less clear. The Late Prehistoric period experienced a cultural upheaval, including changes in settlement patterns, site types, mortuary customs, art styles, and artifact types. Pictograph styles show affinities with northern Mexico and the Big Bend region of Texas, lithic tool types are shared with the rest of Texas, and mortuary customs appear to be introduced from the north and northwest. Clearly, people, rather than ideas, were on the move. Late in prehistory, one intrusive group is identified by a distinctive artifact assemblage, including small arrow points and ceramics, a preference for promontories with sweeping views, and residences that used paired stones as pole supports for a thatch or hide cover. The people of the Infierno phase may be precursors to ethnohistorically described bison hunters who again seasonally congregated at the mouth of the Pecos River during yet another mesic interlude. The Spanish found little of value in the Lower Pecos, isolating it as part of the great uninhabitable desert of their northern frontier, but native peoples found refuge in the rugged terrain. Indigenous groups were soon replaced by Apaches who, in turn, were driven south by the Comanches where they sometimes joined the Kickapoos, staunch allies of the Mexicans, in resisting their common enemy. Under American hegemony, a concerted effort to clear the way west resulted in the extirpation of native people by the time the second transcontinental railroad was completed in 1882.

Smith 1995). The knowledge gained about the native American past in the region, about the challenges faced during times of prehistoric cultural change, and during the wrenching episode (still ongoing) of contact and interaction between the Caddo peoples and European and Anglo- American colonizers and settlers (Perttula 1998b) helps to make ""native history"" an integral part of-rather than a footnote to-the ongoing study of Texas' cultural heritage. While there is every reason to think that our knowledge of northeastern Texas prehistory will continue to grow by leaps and bounds, there are tremendous research and preservation challenges ahead for each prehistoric era. On a mundane level, it is important that we continually cast a critical and discerning eye at our research priorities for prehistoric and Caddoan archeological sites, the value of our methodological approaches, and the worth of our cultural resource management planning documents. From the innovative use of these tools come the new perspectives and conceptions that lead to a broader understanding of the past. Changes in research strategies are critical, but in northeastern Texas they are, unfortunately, only part of the archeological story. Of the utmost concern for the long-term protection and preservation of the region's priceless archeological heritage is dealing directly with the unabated looting and vandalism of prehistoric Caddo villages and cemeteries-on private as well as state and federal lands (Perttula and Nelson 1999). The archeological landscape is pitted and pocked with the looter's holes and backdirt piles. Many of the most important archeological sites in the region have been irretrievably damaged and destroyed, and it is questionable that the looting frenzy can be quelled even should an unmarked burial protection bill ever be made law in Texas; the situation is not much better in Arkansas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. The cultural patrimony of the Caddo peoples is being taken from them, with almost no hand being lifted to help protect these significant cultural treasures. This challenge is our greatest in the years ahead: to find a way, in concert with the Caddo people, to protect and preserve this cultural legacy: ""In 1541 when the Spaniards arrived, every place in the Caddo country had, of course, a Caddo name but almost all of those names are gone now, like the people who bestowed them"" (Schambach 1993, 7).

Chronology was strictly relative, since no radiocarbon dates had yet been obtained in the area, and a cultural sequence could be defined only on the basis of the stratigraphic positions of identifiable artifact assemblages.

Power analysis, although generally not employed by biological anthropologists, is especially useful in interpreting statistical tests in which the null hypothesis is not rejected, and in determining appropriate sample sizes. In this report, the utility of statistical power analysis and the level of variation in power is illustrated by performing power analysis on paleopathology data (Cohen and Armelagos: Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture, 1984). The power analyses indicate that most samples are adequately large for detecting large differences among groups, but are inadequate for detecting small differences. Statistical analyses with inadequate power to detect small to medium effects may be of questionable utility in many areas of biological anthropology, as well as in paleopathology. The application of power analysis is recommended for determining necessary sample size in advance of data collection and for interpreting negative results.

The complex dates to the period between a.d. 500 and 1100/1200, and a wide range of activities and site functions are inferred for the three types of habitation sites that are recognized. The Kent Creek and Sam Wahl sites are identified as residential bases where people lived in pithouses while procuring, processing, storing, and consuming a wide range of wild plant foods. Mesquite beans and shin oak acorns have been identified as possible staples, but other plants such as goosefoot and buffalo gourds also may have been important foods. Although no cultigens have been found, this situation does not preclude the possibility that limited horticulture was practiced at residential sites. Occupations at these villages were at least seasonal (i.e., during late summer to fall harvest and into winter) and may have been biseasonal (i.e., during planting and then again during fall harvest and into winter). Palo Duro peoples lived in rockshelters and open camps at various times of the year and for different reasons. Some rockshelters were occupied on a sporadic and ephemeral basis, while others were more intensively used and may have served as relatively permanent bases. Some camp sites were little more than specialized processing sites where baking and grinding of plant foods were the primary activities, while others were multifunctional bases where considerable hunting and process-ing of animals was done. Deer and small animals appear to have been the principal game animals. Bison were hunted but do not appear to have been a major food resource, and the evidence suggests that populations may have been relatively low. Palo Duro culture is now viewed as representing semisedentary peoples who maintained a high degree of residential mobility in order to exploit a wide range of resources that were locally available and abundant on a seasonal basis. Sites of this complex are found mainly in the Caprock Canyonlands, an ecological subregion that offered the most predictable and widest range of subsistence resources (water, plants, and animals) within a relatively arid landscape. The home territory for Palo Duro peoples was in the upper drainages of the Red and Brazos Rivers, although they may have ranged on occasion north into the Canadian River valley, east into the Rolling Plains, south into the upper Colorado River drainage, and west onto the Llano Estacado. Human burials provide evidence of widespread violence in and around the Caprock Canyonlands during the Late Prehistoric I period, and the Palo Duro culture may have come into periodic contact with enemy peoples to the north and east (Lake Creek or Plains Woodland groups) and to the south and southeast (Blow Out Mountain and other undefined groups). Palo Duro peoples did maintain some form of cultural contact with the Jornada Mogollon peoples of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas over a long period of time. There appears to be a significant amount of Jornada Mogollon cultural influence across the southern Llano Estacado and into the Caprock Canyonlands, and the Palo Duro Complex exhibits many traits (e.g., imported brownware pottery and pithouse architectural styles) that were derived, whether directly or indirectly, from the Jornada Mogollon region. In addition, the similarities between the subsistence and settlement patterns proposed for the Palo Duro Complex and those proposed for their eastern Jornada Mogollon neighbors may be more than a mere coincidence. In summary, it is unclear whether the Palo Duro Complex represents an actual migration of Jornada Mogollon or related peoples or whether it simply represents indigenous Southern Plains people who came under the widespread influence of Jornada Mogollon culture or something much more complex.
