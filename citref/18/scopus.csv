Using these methods, a large-scale magnetic gradiometry survey at the Battle Mound site (3LA1), a premier Middle and Late Caddo mound site located in the Red River Great Bend region, produced an informative archaeogeophysical data set of numerous anomalies that can be attributed to both archaeological and geological sources. Findings include convincing evidence for burned rectangular and circular structures, a possible community cemetery, a farmstead with a compound fence, the extent of an historic occupation, and natural phenomena that include lighting strikes and palaeochannels of the Red River. The magnetic gradiometry survey not only has demonstrated the usefulness of archaeogeophysics as a primary data set in archaeological interpretation but also has provided a unique data set regarding the cultural and natural history at the Battle Mound site.",,"archaeology; cultural history; Holocene; settlement pattern; Red River [United States]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77649309555
