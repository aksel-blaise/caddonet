T. King site (41NA15) is an early-eighteenth-century Caddo habitation site in East Texas. Recent archaeogeophysical work (covering 2.5 ha) at the site has obtained unique data on the spatial organization of a Caddo settlement that was occupied at the time of the Spanish colonization of East Texas. Our interpretation of the magnetometer data is that there are 10 possible Caddo structures in the archaeogeophysical survey area. A few magnetic anomalies have been successfully ground truthed at the J. T. King site. These test excavations have demonstrated a positive correlation between magnetometer anomalies and the occurrence of Caddo architectural features.",,"archaeology; eighteenth century; geophysical survey; magnetic anomaly; magnetometer; settlement history; settlement pattern; spatial analysis; Nacogdoches County; Texas; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951892056
