In this paper, the history of the use of geophysical techniques in archaeology will be discussed, as will significant research themes associated with the most widely used prospecting devices. It is apparent that while the use of geophysical techniques is at an all-time high, there are many key areas where prospecting is rapidly developing. Some of the advances relate to fundamental aspects of the techniques, while others dictate how we undertake survey in the future. There is a movement away from pre-gridded survey areas towards real-time GPS for navigation. This allows greater integration, or fusion, of disparate data sources using visualization techniques derived from associated disciplines. The analysis of landscapes has become a major component of the application of new technology and there are many challenges to be tackled, including how to analyse and interpret significant archaeology within large-scale, data-rich, multi-technique investigations. The reflective nature of the review acknowledges the important role of Archaeometry in the development of archaeological geophysics. © University of Oxford, 2008.","Earth resistance; Electromagnetic; GPR; GPS; Landscape; Magnetometry; Resistivity; Visualization","archaeology; detection method; electrical resistivity; geophysical survey; GPS; ground penetrating radar; landscape; magnetometer; real time; visualization",,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-41149176574

In the paper the authors describe the strategy for assessing a large site, approximately 0.7 km2 in size, as well as presenting the graphical results. Prior to the survey it was believed that Wroxeter was a ‘garden city’ with areas of open space inside the defensive ramparts. The results of the magnetic survey, however, suggested that almost the whole of the area contains significant archaeological anomalies. The interpretation of the data has provided a wealth of detail concerning the layout and zonation of the city. Although many of the most prestigious buildings were already known, it is the evidence for the lower status occupants of the city that is of particular note. For the first time geophysical survey has defined the settlement areas as well as suggesting industrial zones where the lower status population of Roman Wroxeter are believed to have worked.

Recent remote sensing work at the Hill Farm site (41BW169) on the Red River in northeast Texas, along with available archaeological information from the shallowly buried site, has led to an unusually detailed view of the archaeological character of ca. A.D. 1600-1700 Nasoni Caddo village compounds that can be linked with the 1691 Teran map. Remote sensing has considerable potential to lead to long-term collaborative archaeogeophysical and archaeological projects to understand Caddo community-scale organization and landscapes.",,"archaeological evidence; archaeology; documentary source; mapping; remote sensing; North America; Red River [United States]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349096942
