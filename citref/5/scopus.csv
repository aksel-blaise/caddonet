The site, located along the Little River, consists of seven mounds arranged in a horseshoe configuration. Archaeological excavations at the site have been limited to a series of posthole tests and three 1-x-l-m units. Between November 2011 and February 2012, the Oklahoma Archeological Survey conducted geophysical survey of the bulk of the site, covering approximately 32, 000 m2with a fluxgate gradiometer. This study provides important information about Caddo mound construction, settlement, and ceremonialism in southeastern OK and add to a growing body of literature on prehistoric Caddo community patterns.",,"archaeology; excavation; geophysical survey; prehistoric; settlement pattern; Georgia; Little River [Georgia]; Oklahoma [United States]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906718257
