It is shown through a series of case studies from two regions in North America that archaeo-geophysical surveys can produce primary information suitable for the study of site content, structure and organization, for examining spatial patterns and relationships, and for directly confronting specific questions about a site and the past. Because large buried cultural landscapes can now be revealed, it is argued that an alternative perspective on regional or landscape archaeology may be possible because space can be viewed in terms of tens of hectares as opposed to the lens of square meters typical of archaeological excavations. Moreover, by placing focus on such buried features as dwellings, storage facilities, public structures, middens, fortifications, trails, or garden spaces that are not commonly revealed through most contemporary surface inspection methods, a richer view of archaeology, the past, and cultural landscapes can be achieved. Archaeo-geophysical suneys can also play an important role in Cultural Resource Management (CRM) contexts as feature discovery tools for focusing expensive excavations, thereby reducing the amount needed and lowering costs. Their utility is weighed against shovel test pits as a primitive and costly form of prospecting. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeoli.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645082412

Construction entailed significant earth-moving and labor effort in addition to the erection of mounds flanking the plaza. At Raffman plaza, building is dated ca. A.D. 700-1000. Like the mounds at the site, the arrangement, shape, and dimensions of the plaza changed through time. The final plan of the plaza was the result of a rapid major reconfiguration of the spatial layout of the site at approximately A.D. 1000. The effort expended on planning and construction of the plaza at Raffman and similar features at contemporary and later sites in the southeastern United States indicates that plazas are not just empty spaces that developed because architecture enclosed an open area; they must be understood as one of the central design elements of community planning and intrasite spatial organization. Further research should be devoted to exploring how southeastern mound-and-plaza groups were constructed with specific efforts devoted to comprehending how plazas were laid out and built.Las investigaciones en el sitio Raffman (16MA20), un centro de múltiples montícules en el valle bajo del Mississippi de Luisiana nororiental, demuestran que la plaza se construyó y extendió con un propósito determinado en su extreme norte. La construcción supuso un significativo desplazamiento de tierra y esfuerzo laboral, además del levantamiento de los montículos al lado de la plaza. La construcción de la plaza de Raffman data de los años 700-1000 d.C.Al igual que los montículos del sitio, la disposición, la forma y las dimensiones de la plaza fueron cambiando con el paso del tiempo. El plano final de la plaza fue el resultado de una rápida e importante reconfiguración de la distribución espacial del sitio en el año 1000 d.C., aproximadamente. El esfuerzo invertido en el diseño y la construcción de la plaza de Raffman, y características similares a las de otros sitios contemporáneos y posteriores en el sudeste de los Estados Unidos indican que las plazas no fueron sólo espacios vacios que surgieron al construirse alrededor de áreas abiertas. Las plazas deben ser entendidas, en cambio, como uno de los elementos de diseńo centrales en la planificación de la comunidad y en la organización espacial dentro de los sitios (inuasite). Las investigaciones futuras deben dedicarse a explorar cómo los grupos de plazas y montículos del sudeste se construyeron con propósitos específicos, y orientados a entender cómo se trazaron y construyeron las plazas.

While only some anthropological questions can be addressed by shallow geophysics, these techniques provide an opportunity to address some important questions that are fundamental to archaeology. One such agenda is the investigation of 'persistent places', which is rooted in anthropological inquiry and which can be investigated, at least in part, by shallow geophysical techniques. For the next stage in the use of remote sensing that goes beyond mere prospection, research agendas must be clearly linked with broader theoretical concepts of what we term inquiry-based archaeogeophysics. Specifically with regard to the application of geophysics to the study of persistent places, we propose four categories of research that relate to the meaning, context and changing function of such places. These categories include: construction variation, continuity and discontinuity in the use of space, studying natural and/or cultural landscape modifications over time and space, and constancies in the use of space and architecture at the regional level. In order to illustrate these points, we provide examples from sites in Mexico and the USA that represent different time periods (2500 BC to AD 1000), adaptations (hunter-gatherers to intensive agriculturists), and levels of socio-political complexity (egalitarian to stratified societies). The use of geophysics at these persistent places contributes to our understanding of changes in the use of space and architecture through time. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Landscape; Method and theory; Persistent place; Shallow geophysics; Space and architecture",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051891535

This synthesis of Etowah's development as a Mississippian political center is based on my examination of documents and collections from the major excavations conducted at the site. A comparison of Etowali's history to the developmental sequences of two other major Mississippian mound centers, Moundville and Cahokia, shows that Etowah developed within a region where it was difficult to establish the same long-term political dominance attained by Cahokia and Moundville. Individual Mississippian centers were parts of larger regions with distinct ecological and social histories. This comparison also indicates that Etowah's political economy was oriented along individual-centered or network principles during its rise to power ca. AD 1300, while the political economies of Moundville and Cahokia focused on group-oriented or corporate principles during their periods of political ascendance ca. AD 2050-1200.

Consisting of 18 earthen mounds and numerous additional habitation areas dating to A.D. 1250-1550, the Bottle Creek site was first professionally investigated in 1932 when David L. DeJarnette of the Alabama Museum of Natural History began work there to determine if the site had a cultural relationship with Moundville, connected to the north by a river system. Although partially mapped in the 1880s, Bottle Creek's location in the vast Mobile-Tensaw Delta of Baldwin County completely surrounded by swamp made it inaccessible and protected it from most of the plunder experienced by similar sites in the Southeast. This volume builds on earlier investigations to present extensive recent data from major excavations conducted from 1991 to 1994 and supported in part by an NEH grant. Ten anthropologists examine various aspects of the site, including mound architecture, prehistoric diet, pottery classification, vessel forms, textiles used to make pottery impressions, a microlithic stone tool industry, water travel, the persistence of mound use into historic times, and the position of Bottle Creek in the protohistoric world. The site is concluded to be the best remaining example of Pensacola culture, an archaeological variant of the widespread Mississippian tradition identified by a shell-tempered pottery complex and by its geographic association with the north-central coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Occupied for three centuries by a thriving native culture, Bottle Creek is an important remnant of North American peoples and as such is designated a National Historic Landmark. This published compilation of the research data should establish a base for future scholarly investigation and interpretation. Ian W.

Despite often numbering in the millions within a single field, their origin has been a mystery, with proposed explanations ranging from glacial processes to seismic shaking. One hypothesis proposes that mounds in North America are built by burrowing mammals to provide refuge from seasonally saturated soils. We test this hypothesis with a numerical model, parameterized with measurements of soil transport by gophers from a California mound field, that couples animal behavior with geomorphic processes. The model successfully simulates the development of the mounds as well as key details such as the creation of vernal pools, small intermound basins that provide habitat for endemic species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial structure of the modeled mound fields is similar to actual mound fields and provides an example of self-organized topographic features. We conclude that, scaled by body mass, Mima mounds are the largest structures built by nonhuman mammals and may provide a rare example of an evolutionary coupling between landforms and the organisms that create them. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Bioturbation; Emergent features; Gophers; Self-organized",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894959537

As part of economic relief intended to mitigate the economic collapse of the early 1930s under the weight of the Dust Bowl droughts and the Great Depression, sites had been identified and tested in 12 counties. Beginning in 1933, the bulk of the archaeology had taken place at sites in the Arkansas River drainage system, culminating most notably in the cleanup of the regrettable looting and destruction of the Craig Mound at Spiro. As federal funds continued to be poured into work relief programs, field crews moved to nearby Mississippian mounds and villages and a series of Late Archaic and Woodland midden mounds along Fourche Maline Creek. In May 1941, University of Oklahoma archaeologist David Baerreis started operations in McCurtain County in the southeast corner of Oklahoma. For the next nine months, Baerreis directed excavations at two prehistoric Caddo sites along the Glover River, the mound center at Clement (34MC8-10) and what was presumed until recently to be the much smaller McDonald site (34MC11/12). The excavations came to a halt in early 1942 when the United States entered World War II and the Great Depression ended. Federal funds were shifted to the war effort, and workers, including Baerreis himself, were sent overseas (Rogers 1978). © 2013 by The University of Alabama Press.

A site receiving renewed attention is the Collins site (3WA1), a possible Early to Middle Mississippian period (A.D. 900-1400) multimound site on the White River hi Elkins, Arkansas. A landscape-based geomagnetic survey of Mounds B, C, D, and the surrounding area offers a preliminary distributional view of architectural features and their proposed functions, which hint at the importance of the site as a paramount mound complex associated with ritual mortuary events linking regional supporting populations. Mound-top enclosures and off-mound rectangular and possible circular structures are clearly evident in the geomagnetic data and are interpreted as large rectangular-shaped mound structures or enclosures that likely represent specialized use associated with mortuary ritual and architecture, two rectangular and one circular structure associated xuith the interior of a charnel house structure, and one circular and 12 rectangular off-mound structures associated with a possible centralized plaza space. Results demonstrate that a complex prehistoric settlement existed at the Collins site with the presence of subsurface archaeological features associated with Mounds B, C, and D, and throughout the off-mound survey areas.",,"archaeological evidence; archaeology; architectural design; geomagnetic field; geophysical survey; Mississippian; prehistoric; Ozark Mountains; United States; White River [United States]",,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883247549
