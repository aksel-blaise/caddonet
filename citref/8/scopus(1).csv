It begins with an outline of the main principles governing the distribution of stable light isotopes in foodwebs and the quality control issues specific to the calcified tissues used in these analyses, and then proceeds to describe the historical landmark studies that have marked major progress, either in their archaeological applications or in enhancing our understanding of the tools. They include the adoption of maize agriculture, marine-focused diets amongst coastal hunter-gatherers, trophic level amongst Glacial-period modern humans and Neanderthals, and the use of savannah resources by early hominins in Africa. Particular attention is given to the progress made in addressing the challenges that have arisen out of these studies, including issues related to the routing of dietary nutrients. I conclude with some firm, and some more speculative, pointers about where the field may be heading in the next decade or so. © 2008 University of Oxford.","Apatite; Bones; Collagen; Diet; Maize; Marine; Stable light isotopes; Teeth","apatite; archaeology; bone; food web; stable isotope; tooth; Zea mays",,,Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-57149113203

In contrast, plots of Δ13Ccollagen against Δ13C apatite provide a model of three regression lines (C3, C4, and marine diet protein) where position on each line indicates the energy source (C3, C4, or mixed). Neither body size nor trophic position appears to affect these relationships. Modern free-ranging, terrestrial fauna do not fit the model perhaps because they, unlike the experimental fauna, mainly use fermentation rather than digestion during energy metabolism. Archaeological humans fall as expected based on associated floral and faunal evidence. Foraging people plot at positions expected from associated C3 fauna and plants. Those from Cahokia plot, as expected, from associated deer, nuts, and maize whereas people from nearby smaller sites plot in positions consistent with eating more fish. Agriculturists from Ontario and Grasshopper Pueblo plot consistent with dependence on fish by the former and on turkeys by the latter. In Tierra del Fuego, people from interior regions ate more terrestrial fauna, as suggested by ethnohistoric reports, than did people from the coast. In the Southwestern Cape in South Africa individuals late in the sequence have pure C3 diets whereas ones early in the sequence ate marine protein as suggested by independent archaeological evidence.

The isotopic composition of marine and terrestrial food resources from the Marianas have also been determined. Experimental evidence shows that collagen carbon isotopes mainly reflect those of dietary protein sources and thus overestimate the contribution of marine animal foods. Marine protein consumption apparently ranges from ~20% to ~50% on these islands. Experiments also demonstrate the carbon isotope ratio of bone apatite carbonate accurately reflects that of the whole diet. Carbonate carbon isotope data suggest some individuals consumed significant amounts of 13C-enriched (C4) plants or seaweeds. Sugar cane is an indigenous C4 crop and seaweeds are eaten throughout the Pacific, but they have not been considered by archaeologists to have been prehistoric dietary staples. Apatite carbon isotope analysis has apparently identified previously unrecognized prehistoric dietary adaptations in the Mariana Islands, but this must be confirmed by archaeobotanical evidence.","Apatite; Archaeology; Carbon and nitrogen isotopes; Collagen; Micronesia; Paleodiet","archeology; conference paper; diet; Federated States of Micronesia; food chain; food composition; food intake; Guam; human; Pacific islands; protein intake; skeleton; Bone and Bones; Carbon Isotopes; Collagen; Diet; Female; History, Medieval; Humans; Male; Micronesia; Nitrogen Isotopes; Paleopathology",,,Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030699347

Substantial status- and gender-related differences in burial style are apparent. Some burials are associated with large quantities of prestigious grave goods, suggesting high status. Mass graves of young adult females with skeletal indicators of poor health suggest low status and nutritional stress. Nitrogen isotope ratios of bone collagen show that high status individuals ate much more animal protein, but carbon isotope ratios of collagen suggest these individuals ate only ca. 10% less maize than lower status individuals. Apatite carbon isotopes show low status females ate ca. 60% more maize than high status individuals, which confirms the large nitrogen isotope difference of females in mass graves. These results indicate high and low status individuals had significantly different diet compositions and nutritional qualities. The stable isotope evidence supports paleopathological data for status-related differences in health, and dental morphological data for presumed genetic differences in origin.

The main difference between the two transects is the steeper elevational gradient for mean annual and summer precipitation in the southern transect. For any given species, we found that isotopic differences between individual plants growing at the same site commonly equal differences measured for plants along the entire altitudinal gradient. In C3 plants, δ13Cleaf values become slightly enriched at the lowest elevations, the opposite of trends identified in more humid regions. Apparently, increasing water-use efficiency with drought stress offsets the influence of other biotic and abiotic factors that operate to decrease isotopic discrimination with elevation. For some species shared by the two transects (e.g., Pinus edulis and Cercocarpus montanus), δ13Cleaf values are dramatically depleted at sites that receive more than 550 mm mean annual precipitation, roughly the boundary (pedalfer-pedocal) at which soils commonly fill to field capacity in summer and carbonates are leached. We hypothesize that, in summer-wet areas, this may represent the boundary at which drought stress overtakes other factors in determining the sign of δ13Cleaf with elevation. The opposition of isotopic trends with elevation in arid versus humid regions cautions against standard correction for elevation in comparative studies of δ13Cleaf.","C3 and C4 plants; Carbon isotope composition; Elevation; Precipitation; Slope aspect","aspect; C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon isotope; drought stress; elevation; leaf; precipitation (climatology); United States; Cercocarpus montanus; Gymnospermae; Magnoliophyta; Pinus edulis","U.S. Geological Survey, USGS

The proportion of maize in the diet of a human can therefore be estimated from the 13C-content of collagen of fossil bone. We have used this method to follow the increase in consumption of maize in ancient native populations over the interval from AD 400 to 1650, and to quantify the amount of maize consumed. Maize consumption rose gradually to a maximum of 50% of the diet by AD 1400. These data agree with archaeologically derived data for this region, and with previous isotope studies in the northeastern U.S.A. In some of the latter, however, the maximum percentage of maize consumed has been overestimated because maize was assumed to have a δ13C value of -12·5‰; our studies of archaeological specimens show the correct value to be closer to -9‰. The introduction of beans into the native diet about AD 1100, should have caused a decrease in the 15N content of human bone collagen because legumes are deficient in this isotope, with respect to meat and fish. However, we observe no significant change in the 15N14N ratio of human bone collagen over the period from 2300 BC to AD 1640. We conclude that meat and fish remained the main sources of protein even after the advent of agriculture into this region. © 1985.","amaranth; bean; bone; C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon isotope; chenopod; collagen; great lakes prehistory; huron; iroquois; maize; nitrogen isotope; palaeodiet; woodland","amaranth; bean; carbon isotope; chenopod; Great Lakes; Iroquois; maize; nitrogen isotope; prehistory",,"Acknowledgements This research was supported by a grant to Melbye and Schwartz from the Ontario Heritage Foundation.

The usefulness of C4 grasses for this purpose hinges on the assumption that their photosynthetic discrimination against 13C remains constant in a wide range of environmental conditions. We tested this assumption by examining the effects of light and water stress on the carbon isotope composition of C4 grasses using different biochemical subtypes (NADP-ME, NAD-ME, PCK) in glasshouse experiments. We grew 14 different C4 grass species in four treatments: sun-watered, sun-drought, shade-watered and shade-drought. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) rarely remained constant. In general, Δ values were lowest in sun-watered grasses, greater for sun-drought plants and even higher for plants of the shade-watered treatment. The highest Δ values were generally found in the most stressed grasses, the shade-drought plants. Grasses of the NADP-ME subtype were the least influenced by a change in environmental variables, followed by PCK and NAD-ME subtypes. Water availability affected the carbon isotope discrimination less than light limitation in PCK and NAD-ME subtypes, but similarly in NADP-ME subtypes. In another experiment, we studied the effect of increasing light levels (150 to 1500 μmol photons m-2 s-1) on the Δ values of 18 well-watered C4 grass species. Carbon isotope discrimination remained constant until photon flux density (PFD) was less than 700 μmol photons m-2 s-1. Below this light level, Δ values increased with decreasing irradiance for all biochemical subtypes. The change in Δ was less pronounced in NADP-ME and PCK than in NAD-ME grasses. Grasses grown in the field and in the glasshouse showed a similar pattern. Thus, caution should be exercised when using C4 plants under varying environmental conditions to monitor the concentration or carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 in field/glasshouse studies or climate reconstruction.","C4 grasses; Carbon isotope; Climate reconstruction; Discrimination; Global change; Light; Water; δ13C",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030063197

The method is based on our knowledge of isotopic patterns in plants, which are subject to taxonomic and environmental variability. While previous researchers have addressed isotopic variability amongst plants, no studies have looked extensively at a broad suite of taxa over multiple temporal scales from within the savanna biome so as to provide baseline data for palaeodietary and palaeoenvironmental studies. Here we document variations in the isotopic compositions of plants collected over two years from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, with respect to species and anatomical differences, and the influences of geological substrate and spatio-temporal shifts in climate. Results show that environmentally-induced carbon isotopic variations in plants within this region are generally smaller than 2‰, which is lower than what has been previously reported for plants compared across multiple habitat-types. These data suggest that δ13C differences of ∼2‰ or more (or ∼1‰ if the diet is predominantly C4) between animals from a given area reliably indicate real dietary differences. Plant δ15N values vary greatly between different microhabitats (by up to 4‰), responding to a range of environmental influences that may, in turn, significantly influence variation in animal δ15N values. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Bone collagen stable isotope signatures covary with reliance on maize and intake of animal protein, facilitating useful reconstructions of past diet. Among the GSL Fremont, economic strategies vary over time with an initial increase in reliance on maize (A.D. 400-850) followed by a period of marked economic diversity (A.D 850-1150) then a return to reliance on wild foods (after A.D. 1150). During the period of greatest economic diversity, male and female diets vary significantly and male diets are correlated with status differences evidenced by grave goods. There is also a clear temporal correlation between the rapid abandonment of maize agriculture and significant moisture anomalies in regional tree-ring chronologies and pollen profiles.

Isotope analysis of 185 collagen samples drawn from early prehistoric, late prehistoric, and contact-period mortuary sites encompasses two major adaptive shifts in the region, namely the adoption of maize agriculture in late prehistory and the increased emphasis on maize during the mission period. Prior to European contact - and especially before the establishment of Spanish missions among the Guale, Yamasee, Timucua, and Apalachee tribal groups - diet was strongly influenced by local environmental factors. Before contact, coastal and inland populations had different patterns of food consumption, as did populations living in Georgia and Florida. Coastal populations consumed more marine and less terrestrial foods than inland populations. In general, maize was adopted during the eleventh century A.D. by virtually all Georgia populations. However, with the exception of the Lake Jackson site, a major Mississippian center in northern Florida, Florida populations show little use of maize before contact. Following European contact, maize became widespread, regardless of location or habitat within the broad region of Spanish Florida. Missionization appears to have been an important factor in the convergence of native diets toward agriculture and away from foraging. This increased emphasis on maize contributed to a decline in quality of life for native populations.

Archaeological interpretations have tended to associate maize dependence with the rise of major centres, such as Cahokia. These models, based upon volume and ubiquity of maize in village site middens and features, frequently contrast the key role of maize in regional centres with the situation in smaller, remote communities. Mississippian inhabitants of frontier villages, for instances, are assumed to be less maize-dependent than their counterparts in larger and more complex communities. Recent analyses of stable carbon isotope ratios have, however, called into question standard archaeological interpretations. A series of δ13C values that characterize the period of agricultural intensification in the central Mississippi and Illinois river valleys identifies significant maize dependence at locations some distance from Cahokia during its period of major regional influence. Time transgressive trends apparent in maize ubiquity for the Cahokia region also stand in contrast to those seen in diachronic sequences of δ13C values. In this paper, we present newly generated δ13C values for five sites from the central Mississippi and Illinois river regions.

Carbon and nitrogen stable-isotope ratios in food items and in bone collagen were measured to monitor the dependence on maize and bison meat. The results do not provide support for the hypothesis that bison replaced mule deer in the diet during the period of significant Plains-Pueblo trade. If bison, whose diets are relatively enriched in 13C had replaced mule deer, an increase in average δ13C values should have occurred. This, however, was not observed.

A set of tropical inbred lines and their hybrids were grown in the field for 2 yr under three different water regimes. First-year plant water use was evaluated by measuring instantaneous traits (stomatal conductance (gs) and steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs)) in individual leaves together with time-integrative traits, which included mineral accumulation in the whole leaves of plants and oxygen isotope enrichment above source water (Δ18O) and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in the same pooled leaves and in mature kernels. Second-year water use was evaluated by measuring leaf temperature, gs and relative water content (RWC). Within each growing condition, hybrids showed higher Fs, mineral accumulation, RWC, and lower leaf temperature, Δ18O and Δ13C than inbred lines. Therefore, hybrids had a better water status than inbred lines, regardless of the water conditions. Differences in grain yield across growing conditions were explained by differences in water-use traits, with hybrids and inbred lines following a common pattern. Within each growing condition, most variations in grain yield, between hybrids and inbred lines, were also explained by differences in plant water-use traits.

Contrary to speculation, neither the initial adoption of maize nor subsequent intensification in its use were correlated with status, gender, or age. A striking bimodal distribution was observed in consumption of native and introduced crops; growing or eating small amounts of maize was apparently not practiced. Fluoride dating confirms the burials are contemporary, and the pattern persists over several hundred years. Possible explanations include issues related to the economics of maize growing, household requirements for storage, exchange, or levies, or individual taste. Also notable were earlier-than-expected dates for intensive exploitation of the maize in this area, in the early Late Woodland, possibly as early as A.D. 400.

Dental specimens are compared from seven sites in Mississippi and one in Alabama ranging in time from the Archaic to the Protohistoric periods. Microwear analysis of phase II dental facets is performed and pit percentages, scratch length and width, and pit length and width are recorded. Analysis of variance statistical tests were performed between temporally contiguous sites. The results indicate that the size and frequency of microwear features decrease through time until the Protohistoric period where pit feature size and frequencies increase significantly. These results are then compared to stable isotope analysis to test whether the methods yield congruent results and to assess additional dietary changes, specifically the increased importance of nut foods. Carbon isotope analysis indicates differences in dietary maize use between the Mississippian and Protohistoric samples and dental microwear analysis show a significant increase in pit percentages and pit size, microwear features generally associated with hard food mastication. One important question addressed is whether there was a return in the Protohistoric period to naturally available resources, specifically hard foods such as nuts, a pattern observed at sites in Alabama and Arkansas. The use of secondary burials in the later Protohistoric period is examined as a possible cause for this microwear pattern. The study demonstrates the importance of integrating different methods when assessing dietary change, especially when ethnobotanical information is not available. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

First, a cluster of dates between about cal A.D. 1250 and 1450 that are temporally concentrated but spatially widespread suggests a relatively sudden increase in the archaeological visibility of maize in New England at this time. The increase in visibility roughly coincides with an increase in maize consumption in the midcontinent, although further studies are needed to clarify the liming of the latter. Second and even more striking is the simultaneous increase in the archaeological visibility of beans as well as maize in New England during the same period. Finally, preliminary evidence suggests that these increases may be related to the use of soils fertilized by alluvial limestone or old shell midden material. © 2002 by the Society for American Archaeolo.",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-29644442343

The empirical bases for this conclusion are shifts in mobility, subsistence, and technology. Paleoarchaic peoples are described as highly mobile, focused on a diversity of animal resources, including birds and small game, and using more exotic toolstone, an aspect of mobility. In contrast, Early Archaic strategies are less mobile, yet more focused on large game, using more local toolstone, and adopting grinding tools presumably to process small seeds. Accompanying this transition is the shift from stemmed to notched projectile points. Data bearing on this transition on the Colorado Plateau have been scarce.

Before assessing the chronology as reflected by these dates, we consider the advantages of using annual deposits rather than wood charcoal for dating and illustrate the practical effects for Central Plains tradition chronology by comparing the distribution of ages of previously-obtained age determinations on wood charcoal with the distribution of ages on annual plants. The analysis shows that dating annual plants produces a tighter and more objectively interpreted age distribution.
