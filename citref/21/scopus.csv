A.D. 1150-1450) Caddo settlement that was completely excavated in the mid-1990s prior to lignite mining activities. Analysis of the architectural remains, key calibrated radiocarbon dates, and changes in ceramic decorations, indicates that the village evolved as three temporally and spatially different communities composed of a number of separate households. Emerging in the latter two communities were important social institutions (a plaza, an earthen mound, and specialized structures with extended entranceways) that bound this singular Caddo community together for approximately 150-200 years (ca. A.D. 1250-1450). Copyright © 2007 by the Society for American Archaeology.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847720945
