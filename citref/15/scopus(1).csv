It is shown through a series of case studies from two regions in North America that archaeo-geophysical surveys can produce primary information suitable for the study of site content, structure and organization, for examining spatial patterns and relationships, and for directly confronting specific questions about a site and the past. Because large buried cultural landscapes can now be revealed, it is argued that an alternative perspective on regional or landscape archaeology may be possible because space can be viewed in terms of tens of hectares as opposed to the lens of square meters typical of archaeological excavations. Moreover, by placing focus on such buried features as dwellings, storage facilities, public structures, middens, fortifications, trails, or garden spaces that are not commonly revealed through most contemporary surface inspection methods, a richer view of archaeology, the past, and cultural landscapes can be achieved. Archaeo-geophysical suneys can also play an important role in Cultural Resource Management (CRM) contexts as feature discovery tools for focusing expensive excavations, thereby reducing the amount needed and lowering costs. Their utility is weighed against shovel test pits as a primitive and costly form of prospecting. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeoli.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645082412

As with famous examples from the Northwest Coast, Caddos once had complex class rankings.

This section is underlain by geological deposits from the Cretaceous period, in contrast to the Tertiary-period deposits that underlie the rest of the West Gulf Coastal Plain of southern Arkansas, with which it nonetheless shares many characteristics. An important difference is that the geological substrate of southwestern Arkansas sometimes includes calcareous materials such as limestone, chalk, and marl. Areas within southwestern Arkansas underlain by these deposits are here referred to as the blackland prairie region. This term does not denote one contiguous area, but rather several discrete areas shown on the General Soil Map of Arkansas as blackland prairie or Oktibbeha-Sumter soil association (USDA Soil Conservation Service 1982; Figure 7.1). Within these areas, calcareous soils supporting blackland prairies and related communities are interspersed with areas of acidic soils covered with pine-hardwood forests like those of the rest of the coastal plain. Roberts (1979) estimated the total area of the blackland prairie region of southwestern Arkansas at about 130,000 ha. Although the landscape is generally made up of rolling hills, slopes of over 50 percent gradient occur, along with at least one nearly vertical cliff (White Cliffs in Little River County). Severe erosion is common, with gullies up to 10 m deep. Level areas are characterized by black soils with high levels of organic matter that give the region its name, but soils abused by poor management practices (such as overgrazing land) and other eroded soils over chalk are olive to white in color. The presence of calcareous geologic materials has had profound effects on the vegetation, soil, and land use of the region. A distinctive landcover type, the blackland prairie, and related savanna, woodland, and forest communities occurred on these calcareous substrates. Owing to a lack of systematic inventories, descriptions, and studies, however, the nature of these communities has been poorly understood. As recently as 1974, no contemporary examples were recognized (Foti 1974). As used here, a prairie is an area dominated by characteristic herbaceous plants (typically over a hundred species). Blackland prairies are those that occur on these distinctive calcareous substrates; they differ in both dominant vegetation and characteristic species from other tallgrass prairies of the Midwest and Midsouth. On calcareous soils within the blackland prairie region of southwestern Arkansas, four prairie communities, six woodland communities, and two forest communities were defined by Hattenbach et al. (2000). The dominant grasses include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and gamma grass (Tripsacum dactyloides) on moister areas. Compassplant (Sil- phium laciniatum) and prairie clover (Dalea purpurea) are typical forbs. These prairies usually occur on shallow soils over chalk ridges or marl (calcareous clay) slopes, often on the steep faces of asymmetrical ridges known as cuestas, which have a shallow slope and a steep slope. On the steep slopes are chalk or marl outcrops mantled with only a thin layer of soil that may be black but is more commonly olive. According to the original land-survey notes, it appears that the prairies occurred primarily on the steep slopes but extended for a distance onto the gentle slopes at the foot of the ridge. However, they were usually replaced by forest within a short distance of the toes of the slopes (Figure 7.2). Woodlands have few enough trees that herbaceous prairie vegetation dominates the ground level (typically 25-60 percent tree cover). Savannas are mostly prairie but with scattered trees. Trees of savannas and woodlands include chinkquapin oak (Quercus muhlenbergii), bois d'arc (Maclura pomifera), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and nutmeg hickory (Carya myristicaeformis). Interestingly, field notes from both the first land survey and current research show that pecan (Carya illinoensis) makes up about 10 percent of the trees within savannas and woodlands in the blackland prairie region. In other regions it is usually associated with sandy riverfronts along large rivers, in contrast to the calcareous clays of the blackland prairies. Eroded spots are common; in some places, bedrock exposures become extensive enough to form chalk glades. Although similar to a prairie or woodland, a glade occurs on rocky substrates of chalk, limestone, and gravel with thin ground cover and bare rock visible. The thin ground cover of glades includes ground plum (Astragalus crassicarpus) and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula). In such areas with very thin soil, the original community developed as woodland dominated by Ashe's juniper (J. asheii) and Durand's oak (Quercus sinuata). A major problem in understanding the original character of southwestern Arkansas is that the area has been subjected to extensive and intensive land uses including row-crop agriculture, grazing, forestry, mining, and urbanization for almost two centuries. These changes have so modified the landscape that it is virtually impossible to find undisturbed areas; consequently, it is difficult to reconstruct the original character of the landscape without the use of historical resources such as those cited in this study. Archaeological studies can provide insight into areas of the landscape that were substantially modified well before historical descriptions were written. Moreover, as the area has been the subject of few ecological studies, there is little baseline information on the character and distribution of natural communities. Because of the dearth of ecological information from southwestern Arkansas, the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission (ANHC) determined in 1985 to increase its efforts within this region. The work began with comprehensive surveys to locate least-disturbed areas. Data on those areas as well as from the scientific literature and historical sources were then used to develop a better understanding of the natural systems of the region, and eventually to preserve representative examples of the region's natural diversity. The purposes of this paper are to synthesize and update 15 years of inventory and study and to present an overview of the historical distribution and character, as well as the present status, potential, and plans for protection and restoration, of natural landscapes of the blackland prairie region of southwestern Arkansas. Comparisons with other blackland prairie ecosystems in the West Gulf Coastal Plain are also made. Detailed physiognomic/floristic classifications of the natural communities and descriptions of current management and restoration efforts are given elsewhere (Zollner et al., this volume). © 2003 by University of Alabama Press.

The development of water resources has always challenged human ingenuity as people have attempted to meet this basic need for survival. Nearly 4,000 years ago the king of Babylon boasted of making the desert bloom after bringing water to it. On the other side of the world, the Hohokam made a different desert bloom with the construction of intricate systems of irrigation canals between about 700 and 1450 a.d.. Long before the birth of Christ, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all had well-developed water-supply systems that allowed these great civilizations to rise to world prominence (Owen 1980). Indeed, a classic theory regarding the very birth of civilization centered on the control of this critical resource (Wittfogel 1957). Water is at once the great enabler and the great limiting factor of human settlement. The type of water source available to support life is strongly connected to human use of the landscape. Settlement patterns and densities are related to the accessibility of a stable and potable water resource to support domestic use. As technologies for providing more stable and higher-quality water sources have emerged through time, populations and settlement distributions have grown and changed. All early settlements initially used primarily surface water; wells generally did not become commonplace until the late 1800s. With the exception of springs, the use of groundwater was unusual throughout most of the nineteenth century until pollution and disease in surface waters forced people to develop subsurface access (Kazmann 1972). The Black Prairie physiographic province of Mississippi (Figure 11.1) is developed on an outcrop of Cretaceous chalk. An investigation into the water resources of this province in Mississippi, where it is commonly referred to as the Black Prairie, shows that geology exerts a stronger control on the presence of sources of water for human use than in other areas of the state not underlain by chalk. Figure 11.2 shows the relationship between the controlling geology and surface-water features on the Black Prairie. Perennial streams do not normally exist unless their sources are outside the province, and almost all streams that do originate on the Black Prairie are ephemeral and depend on rainfall only to provide runoff. The chalk's control over the course of the Tombigbee River on the eastern edge of the Black Prairie is also evident. The development of water resources in the Black Prairie appears to fall into several discrete time categories, each associated with identi- fiable technological innovations that affected the constraints or opportunities for settlement in the region. Each progressively higher level of technology allowed greater opportunity for a less limiting arrangement of house sites and settlement distribution. The purpose of this study is to document the different levels of water-resource technology that were used to support humans as they occupied the Black Prairie from prehistoric times to the present. © 2003 by University of Alabama Press.
