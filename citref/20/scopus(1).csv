It is shown through a series of case studies from two regions in North America that archaeo-geophysical surveys can produce primary information suitable for the study of site content, structure and organization, for examining spatial patterns and relationships, and for directly confronting specific questions about a site and the past. Because large buried cultural landscapes can now be revealed, it is argued that an alternative perspective on regional or landscape archaeology may be possible because space can be viewed in terms of tens of hectares as opposed to the lens of square meters typical of archaeological excavations. Moreover, by placing focus on such buried features as dwellings, storage facilities, public structures, middens, fortifications, trails, or garden spaces that are not commonly revealed through most contemporary surface inspection methods, a richer view of archaeology, the past, and cultural landscapes can be achieved. Archaeo-geophysical suneys can also play an important role in Cultural Resource Management (CRM) contexts as feature discovery tools for focusing expensive excavations, thereby reducing the amount needed and lowering costs. Their utility is weighed against shovel test pits as a primitive and costly form of prospecting. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeoli.",,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645082412

This work exposed large blocks in Late Caddoan period, Texarkana phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1700) archaeological deposits in the Nasoni Caddo village. There were hundreds of post holes, structures, midden deposits, and burials in these village areas that appear to be part of individual Caddo farm compounds.",,"archaeological evidence; farming system; Bowie County; North America; Texas; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-31344443567
