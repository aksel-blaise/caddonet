Recent remote sensing work at the Hill Farm site (41BW169) on the Red River in northeast Texas, along with available archaeological information from the shallowly buried site, has led to an unusually detailed view of the archaeological character of ca. A.D. 1600-1700 Nasoni Caddo village compounds that can be linked with the 1691 Teran map. Remote sensing has considerable potential to lead to long-term collaborative archaeogeophysical and archaeological projects to understand Caddo community-scale organization and landscapes.",,"archaeological evidence; archaeology; documentary source; mapping; remote sensing; North America; Red River [United States]; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-49349096942
