"Lankford G.E.","55606543500;","The ""Path of Souls"": Some death imagery in the southeastern ceremonial complex",2007,"Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms: Interpretations of Mississippian Iconography",,,,"174","212",,35,,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84904233371&partnerID=40&md5=716a26709173b2579e96ce1d439dcd08","The multiple-mound site at Moundville, Alabama, has produced a large collection of whole ceramic vessels, many of which bear engraved designs which are part of the iconography of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. The Moundville appearances of the interregional distribution of SECC images are useful for analysis because they are part of a large local collection which has been well studied and can thus be quantified (Steponaitis 1983). An examination of the Moundville SECC imagery reveals five images that seem to be closely related - hand-and-eye, skull, bone, winged serpent, and raptor (Fig. 8.1). Of the five motifs, the winged serpent and the hand-and-eye appear most frequently. In Steponaitis's catalog they are listed thirty-three and thirty-one times, respectively. The hand-and-eye motif appears to be the connector for the cluster, appearing in connection with all of the other motifs. On twenty vessels it is found alone; on seven it appears with bones; and on two it has a skull with it. The hand-and-eye motif also appears once with a raptor head and once with a winged serpent, but the raptor is alone in its other eleven showings, and the winged serpent stands alone on its other thirty-two bottles. Finally, the skull and bone appear together on three vessels. Neither the skull nor the bone ever appears alone on the ceramics at Moundville, according to Steponaitis's listing (Steponaitis 1983). This cluster of five motifs thus is distinctive in the Moundville iconographic corpus, for it has no other associations. Each of the motifs stands alone or in association with one of the other four. They appear together, but they do not appear randomly in conjunction with the many other images of the SECC. That pattern suggests that the five images are related - hand-and-eye, skull, bones, raptor, and winged serpent belong together in a single iconographic complex. This discrete grouping of five SECC images is the focus of this chapter. Although the evidence is complicated, the argument is simple: the artistic cluster illustrates a complex of beliefs regarding the death of human beings. The mortuary belief complex in question manifests variation in ethnographic details from one tribal group to another, as might be expected, but there is a unifying metaphor which argues for a common core of belief across the Eastern Woodlands and Plains, and probably far beyond that area. That unifying notion is an understanding of the Milky Way as the path on which the souls of the deceased must walk. Demonstrating this interpretation of the iconographic cluster is a complicated problem, for it involves analyzing ethnographic notes and myth texts from a large geographical area, coupled with ethnoastronomical considerations, to produce a synthetic model of the Path of Souls belief complex. That model must then be matched with the iconographic cluster to offer plausible meanings for the images as they were used in the art of Moundville and other SECC sites. What will be offered here is a generalized model of the Path of Souls complex, with examples of the SECC iconographic images from Moundville as they might have fit into the overall mortuary belief pattern. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.
