Even within this one shared architectural tradition there are three geographically distinct patterns in the shape of the specialized buildings and the orientation of their extended entranceways. These geographic differences may reflect the existence of diverse Caddo beliefs on mortuary rituals and cosmological symbolism as well as site-specific decisions on the place of specialized buildings within living communities.",,"archaeology; building; cultural tradition; symbolism; North America; Ozark Mountains; Texas; United States",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-69549126885
