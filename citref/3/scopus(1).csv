Yet this information has not been readily accessible to the atmospheric chemistry community because it was scattered over a large number of publications and reported in numerous different units and reference systems. We have critically evaluated the presently available data and integrated these into a consistent format. On the basis of this analysis we present a set of emission factors for a large variety of species emitted from biomass fires. Where data were not available, we have proposed estimates based on appropriate extrapolation techniques. We have derived global estimates of pyrogenic emissions for important species emitted by the various types of biomass burning and compared our estimates with results from inverse modeling studies.",,"aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; biomass burning; emission; trace gas",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035693625

Brunauer - Emmett - Teller (BET) - N2 surface area (SA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), synchrotron-based near-edge X-ray absorptionfinestructure (NEXAFS), andFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy are used to show how two plant materials (wood and grass) undergo analogous but quantitatively different physical - chemical transitions as charring temperature increases from 100 to 700 ° C. These changes suggest the existence of four distinct categories of char consisting of a unique mixture of chemical phases and physical states: (i) in transitionchars, the crystalline character of the precursor materials is preserved; (ii) in amorphous chars, the heat-altered molecules and incipient aromatic polycondensates are randomly mixed; (iii) composite chars consist of poorly ordered graphene stacks embedded in amorphous phases; and (iv) turbostratic chars are dominated by disordered graphitic crystallites. Molecular variations among the different char categories likely translate into differences in their ability to persist in the environment and function as environmental sorbents. © 2010 American Chemical Society.",,"Amorphous phasis; Anthropogenic pollution; Aromatic carbon; Biochar; Black carbon; Brunauer emmett tellers; Carbon sequestration; Char structure; Chemical complexity; Chemical transition; Environmental sorbents; Graphenes; Incomplete combustion; Molecular levels; Molecular variation; Natural vegetation; New strategy; Physical state; Plant biomass; Plant material; Polycondensates; Precursor materials; Soils and sediments; Solid residues; Surface area; Temperature increase; Turbostratic; Aromatic compounds; Biomass; Carbon black; Infrared spectroscopy; Sediments; Surface chemistry; X ray diffraction; Amorphous materials; black carbon; amorphous medium; anthropogenic source; black carbon; carbon sequestration; combustion; complexity; composite; fire; FTIR spectroscopy; graphite; physicochemical property; phytomass; surface area; absorption spectroscopy; article; biomass; chemical structure; infrared spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Charcoal; Plants; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Temperature; X-Ray Diffraction",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-77249117787

Under these conditions, the profile breaks down into a series of narrow matching bands separated by the spinning speed, and it becomes difficult to establish and maintain an efficient matching condition. Variable-amplitude CP (VACP), as introduced previously (Peersen et al., J. Magn. Reson. A104, 334, 1993), has been proven to be effective for restoring flat profiles at high spinning speeds. Here, a refined implementation of VACP using a ramped-amplitude cross-polarization sequence (RAMP-CP) is described. The order of the amplitude modulation is shown to be of importance for the cross-polarization process. The new pulse sequence with a linear amplitude ramp is not only easier to set up but also improves the performance of the variable-amplitude experiment in that it produces flat profiles over a wider range of matching conditions even with short total contact times. An increase in signal intensity is obtained compared to both con ventional CP and the originally proposed VACP sequence. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-43949161069

However, inorganic C present in the soil as carbonates will interfere with the measurement of soil organic 13C unless removed or excluded from measurement. We report a simple and convenient HCl-fumigation method to remove inorganic C from soil. Soil samples are weighed in Ag-foil capsules, arranged on a microtiter plate, wetted with water to approximately field capacity, and placed in a desiccator containing a beaker with concentrated (12 M) HCl. The carbonates are released as CO2 by the acid treatment in 6 to 8 h. The soil samples are then dried at 60°C prior to isotope determination. The advantages of the HCl-fumigation method to remove inorganic C from the soil are that: (i) no water soluble C will be lost from the soil; (ii) a large number of samples can be processed simultaneously; (iii) the removal of inorganic C is rapid and complete; and (iv) the method could also be used to determine both organic and inorganic C content in the soil.

Black C was collected from 11 historical charcoal blast furnace sites with a geographic distribution from Quebec, Canada, to Georgia, USA, and compared to BC that was newly produced (new BC) using rebuilt historical kilns. The results showed that the historical BC samples were substantially oxidized after 130 years in soils as compared to new BC or BC incubated for one year. The major alterations by natural oxidation of BC included: (1) changes in elemental composition with increases in oxygen (O) from 7.2% in new BC to 24.8% in historical BC and decreases in C from 90.8% to 70.5%; (2) formation of oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carboxylic and phenolic functional groups, and (3) disappearance of surface positive charge and evolution of surface negative charge after 12 months of incubation. Although time of exposure significantly increased natural oxidation of BC, a significant positive relationship between mean annual temperature (MAT) and BC oxidation (O/C ratio with r = 0.83; P &lt; 0.01) explained that BC oxidation was increased by 87 mmole kg C-1 per unit Celsius increase in MAT. This long-term oxidation was more pronounced on BC surfaces than for entire particles, and responded 7-fold stronger to increases in MAT. Our results also indicated that oxidation of BC was more important than adsorption of non-BC. Thus, natural oxidation of BC may play an important role in the effects of BC on soil biogeochemistry. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.",,,"Cornell University

Results produced in this period of expansion have been exciting: BC has been detected in many important geochemical pools, and interesting new research directions open as we learn about the role of this byproduct of biomass burning in the carbon cycle. Especially important research directions will be the quantification of BC loss processes (both biotic and abiotic), measurement of BC decomposition products in environmentally relevant reservoirs, and exploration of the interactions between BC and its host organo-mineral matrix, including the role of BC in pedogenesis. However, along with exciting results, we have also seen apparent discrepancies between BC studies. These discrepancies occur at least in part because of a lack of a common language, common methods, and a common model of BC.

In this paper, solid-state 13C NMR data pertaining to changes in the chemical composition of a diverse range of natural organic materials, including wood, peat, composts, forest litter layers, and organic materials in surface layers of mineral soils, were reviewed with the objective of deriving an index of the extent of decomposition of such organic materials based on changes in chemical composition. Chemical changes associated with the decomposition of wood varied considerably and were dependent on a strong interaction between the species of wood examined and the species composition of the microbial decomposer community, making the derivation of a single general index applicable to wood decomposition unlikely. For the remaining forms of natural organic residues, decomposition was almost always associated with an increased content of alkyl C and a decreased content of O-alkyl C. The concomitant increase and decrease in alkyl and O-alkyl C contents respectively, suggested that the ratio of alkyl to O-alkyl carbon (A/O-A ratio) may provide a sensitive index of the extent of decomposition. Contrary to the traditional view that humic substances with an aromatic core accumulate as decomposition proceeds, changes in the aromatic region were variable and suggested a relationship with the activity of lignin-degrading fungi. The A/O-A ratio did appear to provide a sensitive index of extent of decomposition provided that its use was restricted to situations where the organic materials were derived from a common starting material. In addition, the potential for adsorption of highly decomposable materials on mineral soil surfaces and the impacts which such an adsorption may have on bioavailability required consideration when the A/O-A ratio was used to assess the extent of decomposition of organic materials found in mineral soils.","Chemical composition; Composts; Forest litter; Peat; Soil organic matter; Wood","carbon-13; decomposition rate; NMR; organic matter; Fungi",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030826389

PyC is mainly produced as solid charred residues, including visually-defined charcoal, and a black carbon (BC) fraction chemically defined by its resistance to laboratory oxidation, plus much lower proportions of volatile soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All PyC is characterized by fused aromatic rings, but varying in cluster sizes, and presence of other elements (N, O) and functional groups. The range of PyC structures is often described as a continuum from partially charred plant materials, to charcoal, soot and ultimately graphite which is formed by the combination of heat and pressure. There are several reasons for current interest in defining more precisely the role of PyC in the C cycle of boreal regions. First, PyC is largely resistant to decomposition, and therefore contributes to very stable C pools in soils and sediments. Second, it influences soil processes, mainly through its sorption properties and cation exchange capacity, and third, soot aerosols absorb solar radiation and may contribute to global warming. However, there are large gaps in the basic information needed to address these topics. While charcoal is commonly defined by visual criteria, analytical methods for BC are mainly based on various measures of oxidation resistance, or on yield of benzenepolycarboxylic acids. These methods are still being developed, and capture different fractions of the PyC structural continuum. There are few quantitative reports of PyC production and stocks in boreal forests (essentially none for boreal peatlands), and results are difficult to compare due to varying experimental goals and methods, as well as inconsistent terminology. There are almost no direct field measurements of BC aerosol production from boreal wildfires, and little direct information on rates and mechanisms for PyC loss. Structural characterization of charred biomass and forest floor from wildfires generally indicates a low level of thermal alteration, with the bulk of the material having H/C ratios still &gt;0.2, and small aromatic cluster sizes. Especially for the more oxidation-resistant BC fraction, a variety of mainly circumstantial evidence suggests very slow decomposition, with turnover on a millennial timescale (in the order of 5-7 ky), also dependent on environmental conditions. However, there is also evidence that some PyC may be lost in only tens to hundreds of years due to a combination of lower thermal alteration and environmental protection. The potential for long-term PyC storage in soil may also be limited by its consumption by subsequent fires. Degraded, functionalized PyC is also incorporated into humified soil organic matter, and is transported eventually to marine sediments in dissolved and particulate form. Boreal production is estimated as 7-17 TgBCy-1 of solid residues and 2-2.5 TgBCy-1 as aerosols, compared to global estimates of 40-240 and 10-30TgBCy-1, respectively. Primary research needs include basic field data on PyC production and stocks in boreal forests and peatlands, suitable to support C budget modeling, and development of standardized analytical methods and of improved approaches to assess the chemical recalcitrance of typical chars from boreal wildfires. To accomplish these goals effectively will require much greater emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation.",,"biomass; black carbon; boreal forest; carbon cycle; carbon monoxide; charcoal; fire; global warming; PAH; sediment; shoot; soil",,,Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748847530

P. tremellosus caused progressive weight losses and increased the H/C and O/C of the remnant wood by preferentially degrading the lignin component of the middle lamellae. This fungus increased the absolute (weight loss-corrected) yield of the vanillic acid CuO reaction product above its initial level and exponentially decreased the absolute yields of all other lignin-derived phenols. Total yields of syringyl phenols were decreased 1.5 times as fast as total vanillyl phenol yields. Within both phenol families, aldehyde precursors were degraded faster than precursors of the corresponding ketones, which were obtained in constant proportion to the total phenol yield. Although two other white-rot fungi caused similar lignin compositional trends, a fourth white-rot species, Coriolus versicolor, simultaneously eroded all cell wall components and did not concentrate polysaccharides in the remnant wood. Wood degraded by the three brown-rot fungi exhibited porous cell walls with greatly reduced integrity. The brown-rot fungi also preferentially attacked syringyl structural units, but degraded all phenol precursors at a much slower rate than the white-rotters and did not produce excess vanillic acid. Degradation by P. tremellosus linearly increased the vanillic acid/vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, of the remnant birch wood throughout the 12 week degradation study and exponentially decreased the absolute yields of total vanillyl phenols, total syringyl phenols and the syringyl/vanillyl phenol ratio, S/V.

The amount of organic matter present in these systems is controlled by the relative rates of accumulation and loss. Accumulation is controlled principally by net primary productivity whilst losses are mainly a function of the biological stability of the biomolecules present. Processes of lateral transfer can also be significant to both rates of accumulation and loss in localized zones. In this paper, the processes and properties responsible for defining the biological stability of organic matter in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are examined. A conceptual model illustrating the implications that mechanisms of biological stabilisation can have on the molecular composition of natural organic matter in these ecosystems is presented. Molecular composition has typically been determined using a variety of selective degradative methodologies either individually or in combination. These methodologies often only identify 20-80% of the organic matter present with the extent of identification decreasing as the degree of biological processing increases. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used for routine assessment of the chemistry of organic materials; however, no direct measure of the molecular composition can be obtained. Previous work that examined the ability of using solid-state 13C NMR data in a simple mixing model to predict molecular composition is extended in this study. The extended mixing model is then used to characterise changes in the molecular composition of decomposing organic material in soil and marine systems. The extended mixing model accounted for the distribution of 13C NMR signal intensity of all samples examined and allowed the biomolecular and elemental composition to be estimated. Decomposition induced changes in molecular composition were very different in the terrestrial and marine systems examined, but the direction of change suggested a convergence towards the formation of similar decomposition products. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It has long been of interest to archaeologists because of its potential to inform them about the presence of past human occupation and to offer clues regarding the type and intensity of human activity. A wide variety of methods have been developed in both soil science and in archaeology to extract and measure soil P, resulting in a tremendous amount of data and a wide array of interpretations, but also considerable confusion over appropriateness of methods and terminology. The primary purpose of this paper is to address these issues by clarifying soil P analyses. Anthropogenic additions of phosphorus to the soil come from human refuse and waste, burials, the products of animal husbandry in barns, pens, and on livestock paths, or intentional enrichment from soil fertilizer. Once added to the soil, phosphorus in its common form as phosphate is stable and generally immobile in soils. Soil P comes in many forms, organized for the purposes of this paper on the basis of extraction and measurement procedures as (1) extraction for available P (Pav); (2) portable field techniques (the spot test or ring test); (3) chemical digestion of a soil sample for total P (Ptot); (4) extractions of inorganic P (Pin) for fractionation studies and extractions to look at individual compounds of P; (5) measurements of organic P (Porg); and (6) extractions for total elemental analysis. To compare the suitability of various extractants as the ""best"" indicator of human input and activity we subjected samples from three very different archaeological sites (Lubbock Lake, TX; Hulburt Creek, IA; British Camp, WA) to four methods of soil P extraction: perchloric acid digestion (Ptot), sulfuric-nitric acid extraction Ptot), hydrochloric acid extraction after ignition (Pin), and citric acid extraction (Pav). Further, methods of measurement were compared via colorimetry vs. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometry, and the two methods of supposed ""total P"" were both measured via ICP. In general, the stronger extractants yielded more soil P, but the result are not clear-cut. Likely variables include the intensity of occupation, nature of the parent material, and postdepositional weathering (e.g., the addition of dust). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This organic matter is analyzed as solvent extractable bitumen/lipids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The organic geochemical approach assesses the origin, the environmental history and the nature of secondary products of organic matter by using the data derived from specific molecular analyses. Evaluations of production and fluxes, with cross-correlations can thus be made by the application of the same separation and analytical procedures to samples from point source emissions and the ambient atmosphere. This will be illustrated here with typical examples from the ambient atmosphere (aerosol particles) and from emissions of biomass burning (smoke). Organic matter in aerosols is derived from two major sources and is admixed depending on the geographic relief of the air shed. These sources are biogenic detritus (e.g., plant wax, microbes, etc.) and anthropogenic particle emissions (e.g., oils, soot, synthetics, etc.). Both biogenic detritus and some of the anthropogenic particle emissions contain organic materials which have unique and distinguishable compound distribution patterns (C14-C40). Microbial and vascular plant lipids are the dominant biogenic residues and petroleum hydrocarbons, with lesser amounts of the pyrogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and synthetics (e.g., chlorinated compounds), are the major anthropogenic residues. Biomass combustion is another important primary source of particles injected into the global atmosphere. It contributes many trace substances which are reactants in atmospheric chemistry and soot particulate matter with adsorbed biomarker compounds, most of which are unknown chemical structures. The injection of natural product organic compounds into smoke occurs primarily by direct volatilization/steam stripping and by thermal alteration based on combustion temperature. Although the molecular composition of organic matter in smoke particles is highly variable, the molecular tracers are generally still source specific. Retene has been utilized as a tracer for conifer smoke in urban aerosols, but is not always detectable. Dehydroabietic acid is generally more concentrated in the atmosphere from the same emission sources. Degradation products from biopolymers (e.g., levoglucosan from cellulose) are also excellent tracers. An overview of the biomarker compositions of biomass smoke types is presented here. Defining additional tracers of thermally-altered and directly-emitted natural products in smoke aids the assessment of the organic matter type and input from biomass combustion to aerosols. The precursor to product approach of compound characterization by organic geochemistry can be applied successfully to provide tracers for studying the chemistry and dispersion of ambient aerosols and smoke plumes.","Air pollution; Biomarkers; Biomass burning; Dehydroabietic acid; Homologous compounds; Levoglucosan; PAH; Particulate matter; Petroleum; Triterpenyl fatty acid esters; Wax esters","atmospheric pollution; biomarker; organic geochemistry; tracer","U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, EPA: CR 823990-01-0","Partial funding of this work by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Grant CR 823990-01-0) is gratefully acknowledged.

Modern charcoal samples produced in campfires contain two major phases: graphite-like microcrystallites and a non-organized phase. These phases create a mosaic-like structure with differing relative proportions depending on the taxonomic source of the wood used. Fossil charcoal samples (Tel Dor, Israel: 3000 years BP and Kebara Cave, Israel: 40,000 years BP) also contained the graphite-like microcrystallites and the non-organized phases, but were clearly altered compared to modern charcoal. The graphite-like phase of the fossil charcoal has much higher electrical resistivity, and its ESR properties show that it has markedly altered surface electronic states. Infrared spectra show the presence of additional carboxylate groups. Oxidation has therefore altered the structure. This appears to be a ""self-humification"" process that affects the graphitic component, and probably the non-organized phase as well. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Char and charcoal occur mostly in the low temperature region of the BC continuum and as such are characterized using specific chemical and physical properties that set them apart from the more condensed forms of high temperature BC species (i.e., soot). This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using the molecular marker levoglucosan, exclusively produced from hemicellulose/cellulose combustion, to characterize and quantify char BC in the environment. A second objective was to compare the results from the molecular analysis with those from acid dichromate oxidation in terms of char BC characterization. First, we examined levoglucosan levels in a suite of BC materials derived from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion, as well as non-BC materials (coal and melanoidin). The results confirm that levoglucosan is exclusively in the char BC materials, derived from biomass combustion. However, a large variability in levoglucosan yield was observed among the different char BC materials. To understand the causes of such variability, we analyzed levoglucosan in three series of laboratory-produced char samples (n = 23) made from honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) under controlled combustion conditions (150-1050 °C, 0.5-5 h). The results show that temperature is the most influential factor affecting levoglucosan yield in char. Combustion duration, on the other hand, had no influence on yield. Notably, levoglucosan was only detectable in low temperature char samples (150-350 °C), with maximum yield obtained from samples produced at 250 °C, regardless of plant species. Large differences in levoglucosan yield were also observed across species. This taxonomic difference could not be corrected simply on the basis of hemicellulose and cellulose content, indicating that the relationship between combustion and levoglucosan formation is a complex function of many factors. Our observations also demonstrate that levoglucosan can hardly be used quantitatively for the determination of char BC in environmental samples since such samples often represent mixtures of different chars characterized by variable levoglucosan yield. Acid dichromate oxidation, as opposed to the levoglucosan method, detected mid- to high temperature char BC (≥350 °C) but not low temperature char (≤ 250 °C). Our results indicate that the overlap in the analytical windows of the two methods is limited to the upper limit of the latter. The study demonstrates that levoglucosan can serve as a good qualitative indicator for the presence of char produced under low temperature conditions in soil, sediments, and ultrafine aerosols. Although levoglucosan is not a proper quantitative proxy for char BC content in the environment, this molecular marker has a unique role in the current BC methods continuum because it traces combustion material often missed with most oxidation-based methods. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Two-dimensional perturbation-based correlation infrared spectroscopy (2D-PCIS) was used to study the biochar formation process in three taxonomically different plant biomass, under oxygen-limited conditions along a heat-treatment- temperature gradient (HTT; 200-650 °C). Results from 2D-PCIS pointed to the systematic, HTT-induced defragmenting of lignocellulose H-bonding network and demethylenation/demethylation, oxidation, or dehydroxylation/dehydrogenation of lignocellulose fragments as the primary reactions controlling biochar properties along the HTT gradient. The cleavage of OH-O-type H-bonds, oxidation of free primary hydroxyls to carboxyls (carboxylation; HTT ≤ 500 °C), and their subsequent dehydrogenation/dehydroxylation (HTT &gt; 500 °C) controlled surface charge on the biochars; while the dehydrogenation of methylene groups, which yielded increasingly condensed structures (R-CH 2-R →R=CH-R →R=C=R), controlled biochar recalcitrance. Variations in biochar properties across plant biomass type were attributable to taxa-specific transformations. For example, apparent inefficiencies in the cleavage of wood-specific H-bonds, and their subsequent oxidation to carboxyls, lead to lower surface charge in wood biochars (compared to grass biochars). Both nontaxa and taxa-specific transformations highlighted by 2D-PCIS could have significant implications for biochar functioning in fire-impacted or biochar-amended systems. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Biochar; Condensed structures; Dehydroxylations; Formation process; H-bonding networks; H-bonds; Methylene groups; Plant biomass; Primary reaction; Two-dimensional perturbation; Biomass; Carboxylation; Cellulose; Infrared spectroscopy; Lignin; Oxidation; Surface charge; carbene; carboxyl group; hydroxyl group; lignocellulose; oxygen; amenity; biotransformation; cellulose; charcoal; chemical bonding; environmental degradation; infrared spectroscopy; lignin; oxidation; phytomass; article; biomass; carboxylation; cation exchange; chemical structure; degradation; dehydrogenation; demethylation; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; environmental factor; heat treatment; hydrogen bond; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; oxidation; surface charge; two dimensional perturbation based correlation infrared spectroscopy; Biomass; Charcoal; Hydrogen Bonding; Lignin; Oxidation-Reduction; Plants; Poaceae; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Surface Properties; Temperature; Wood",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867063883

Although usually black on both the outside and inside, the physical and chemical properties differ as a function of temperature and time of exposure to a heat source. Post-depositional processes however may exert additional affects on charcoalified material and introduce bias into the archaeological record. This work explores the influence of alkaline conditions, often encountered in the soil environment, on the preservation potential of charcoalified material. Charcoal, experimentally produced at different temperatures, was exposed to a number of solutions of potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide with different pHs, to simulate exposure to alkaline soil conditions. Under these conditions chemically mediated physical interactions occur resulting in fragmentation of the charcoal samples into (very) small pieces the size of which depends upon the initial temperature of charcoalification. Moreover further interactions result in a decrease in reflectance relative to samples not exposed to alkaline conditions. Although experimentally driven the potential for physical loss of charcoal from a particular site coupled with the reduction in (expected) reflectance of any resident material, has important implications for any conclusions drawn regarding the archaeological record. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The varying extent of these two features is assumed to largely determine the relatively high persistence of charred material in the environment and is thus of interest for, e.g., biochar characterization or carbon cycle studies. Consequently, a variety of methods has been used to assess the aromatic structure of chars, which has led to interesting insights but has complicated the comparison of data acquired with different methods. We therefore used a suite of seven methods (elemental analysis, MIR spectroscopy, NEXAFS spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, BPCA analysis, lipid analysis and helium pycnometry) and compared 13 measurements from them using a diverse sample set of 38 laboratory chars. Our results demonstrate that most of the measurements could be categorized either into those which assess aromaticity or those which assess the degree of aromatic condensation. A variety of measurements, including relatively inexpensive and simple ones, reproducibly captured the two aromatic features in question, and data from different methods could therefore be compared. Moreover, general patterns between the two aromatic features and the pyrolysis conditions were revealed, supporting reconstruction of the highest heat treatment temperature (HTT) of char. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aromatic condensation; Aromaticity; Biochar; Char; Heat treatment temperature; Pyrogenic organic matter; Pyrolysis; Stability","Aromatic compounds; Carbon; Condensation; Convergence of numerical methods; Heat treatment; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Pyrolysis; Spectrum analysis; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; Aromatic structures; Aromaticities; Bio chars; Char; General patterns; Heat treatment temperature; Helium pycnometry; MIR spectroscopy; Aromatization; aromatic hydrocarbon; biofuel; charcoal; condensation; interlaboratory comparison; laboratory method; measurement method; pyrolysis","U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE

Carbon-13 NMR spectra were acquired using both cross-polarisation (CP) and direct polarisation (DP) techniques. Overall, the corresponding CP and DP spectra were similar, although aromaticity was slightly higher and observability much higher when DP was used. The relative size and purity of the aromatic ring structures (i.e. aromatic condensation) were also gauged using the ring current technique. Both aromaticity and aromatic condensation increased with increasing production temperature, regardless of the feedstock source. However, there were clear differences in these two measures for biochars produced at the same temperature but from different feedstocks. Based on a relationship previously established in a long-term incubation study between aromatic condensation and the mean residence time (MRT) of biochar, the MRT of the biochars was estimated to range from &lt;260 years to &gt;1400 years.

A qualitative estimation of vascular plant sources to the Saguenay Fjord shows that the sedimentary terrigenous plant material is comprised predominantly of gymnosperm woods. In the deeper sediment horizons of the upper Saguenay basin, low intensive lignin parameters (C/V and S/V) and high percentages of lignin to total sedimentary organic carbon (&gt; 20%) all indicate elevated concentrations of woody gymnosperm tissues unprecedented in coastal sediments and directly related to the intense activity of the region's pulp and paper industries. The increased control on solid organic wastes from industrial effluents into the Saguenay fiver in the late 1980s to early 1990s is clearly apparent from increasing intensive parameter values and decreasing lignin fractions to the total sedimentary organic carbon (≃ 6-8%) in the upper basin surface sediments. Elemental and molecular analyses of fjord sediments, all indicate that most of the solid-phase discharge of lignified material by the pulp and paper industry is deposited rapidly close to the mouth of the river without reaching the downstream basins. In the St. Lawrence Estuary, intensive lignin parameters indicate that gymnosperm tissues are a major component of the sedimentary vascular plant material but with a significant fraction composed of angiosperm and nonwoody tissues. These latter types of organic tissues are particularly important components of terrigenous material in sediments deposited prior to the 1910-1920s. Acid/aldehyde ratios in most cores studied do not indicate clear-cut oxidative degradation of lignin material prior to its introduction in the aquatic system. The only exceptions are the two estuarine cores, where slightly elevated acid/aldehyde ratios relative to the range for fresh vascular plant tissues, might indicate mild aerobic fungal degradation of the sedimentary lignin material. Organic carbon, total nitrogen, organic phosphorus and lignin derived phenols all exhibited decreasing concentrations with core depth in the sediments of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary. First-order degradation rate constants for all four chemical categories ranged between 0.02-0.05 yr-1. The order of apparent reactivity among the different organic compounds is TN ≤C(org) &gt; P(org) &gt; lignin at the head of the Laurentian channel and lignin ≃ TN = C(org) &gt; P(org) further downstream. The surprising diagenetic selectivity observed at the upstream station is probably due to a higher flux of fresh, labile organic matter that reaches the sediment-water interface and degrades preferentially to more refractory materials such as lignin. Further downstream, little diagenetic selectivity was observed below the sediment-water interface indicating an overall refractory nature of the sedimentary organic matter. Finally, the differences in reactivity observed between C(org) and P(org) at both stations contradict earlier assumptions that no fractionation occurs between organic carbon and phosphorus during anaerobic degradation.",,"diagenesis; lignin; organic matter; sediment chemistry; sources; Canada, Quebec, Saguenay Fjord; Canada, Quebec, St Lawrence Estuary","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC","Financial support for laboratory and analytical expenses for this study was provided by NSERC through operating grants to the authors and a team grant from the Fonds de De’ueloppemenAtc adkmique du Rt%eau de I’Uniuersite du Que’bec (FODAR) attributedt o J-P.

A strong negative correlation exists between the percentage of tree pollen and the concentration of lithogenic elements. For example, the correlation between total tree pollen and Sr concentrations is - 0.94. The main phases of decline of the deciduous forest occurred during known cultural periods (late Neolithic, the Metal Ages, the Roman Period, the Middle Ages and the Industrial period) suggesting a close link between human activities (fires and forest clearances), changes in the vegetation and soil erosion. The flux of lithogenic elements seems to have increased before a significant variation in pollen is detected, which may indicate that changes in soil erosion are reflected earlier than the changes in vegetation in the bog record. Variations in the composition of the deposited dust reflect impacts that occurred at different spatial scales, with local sources dominant in the late Neolithic, the Metal Ages and the Middle Ages, whilst regional sources are more important in the Roman period and the Industrial Revolution. During the prehistoric period, arboreal pollen percentages recovered to their former levels, suggesting that woodland regenerated following a disturbance phase, but for the last 1400 years no significant recovery took place until afforestation with pines was introduced 200 years ago.

Charcoal is an important source of palaeoenvironmental data, and of great interest as a potential carbon sink, due to its high apparent environmental stability. However, at least some forms of charcoal are clearly susceptible to environmental alteration and degradation over relatively short timescales. Although these processes have importance for the role of charcoal in global biogeochemistry, they remain poorly understood. Here we present results of an investigation into the susceptibility of a range of charcoal samples to oxidative degradation in acidified potassium dichromate. The study examines both freshly-produced charcoal, and charcoal exposed to environmental conditions for up to 50,000. years. We compare the proportion of carbon present in different forms between the samples, specifically with respect to the relative chemical resistance of these forms. This was undertaken in order to improve understanding of the post-depositional diagenetic changes affecting charcoal within environmental deposits. A wide range in chemical compositions are apparent both within and between the sample groups. In freshly-produced charcoal, material produced at 300 °C contains carbon with more labile forms than charcoal produced at 400 °C, signifying a key chemical change over the 300-400 °C temperature range. Charcoal exposed to environmental depositional conditions is frequently composed of a highly carboxylated aromatic structure and contains a range of carbon fractions of varying oxidative resistance. These findings suggest that a significant number of the environmental charcoals have undergone post-depositional diagenetic alteration. Further, the data highlight the potential for the use of controlled progressive oxidative degradation as a method to characterize chemical differences between individual charcoal samples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"charcoal; chemical alteration; chemical composition; degradation; diagenesis; oxidation","National Eye Research Centre, NERC: NE/F017456/1, NE/C004531/1","This research was funded by NERC standard Grant NE/F017456/1 and NERC standard Grant NE/C004531/1.

As a consequence, the natural abundance of aged and degraded BC is unknown. We carried out a molecular characterisation of up to ∼7000 yr old charcoal and NaOH-extractable SOM obtained from a colluvial soil in NW Spain using Curie point pyrolysis-GC/MS and THM. Black C was tentatively quantified using solid state 13C CP and DP NMR in conjunction with a molecular mixing model (MMM), and the use of BPCAs. Not surprisingly, the charcoal consisted for the most part of chemically distinctive BC moieties, as concluded from CP and DP NMR-MMM (&gt;72% BC-inherent C) and the BPCA method (30-40%). Charcoal produced mainly benzene, toluene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) upon pyrolysis and THM. The SOM was a mixture of BC-derived (producing benzene, toluene, PAHs and benzonitrile on pyrolysis) and non-BC lipid, carbohydrate and protein-derived OM. Benzenes, PAHs and benzonitrile accounted for 41-54% (pyrolysis-GC/MS) and 34-58% (THM) of total identified peak area in extractable SOM, comparable with the 32-41% BC obtained using DP NMR-MMM. Combined results suggested that the SOM BC was a partially oxidised, N-containing, weakly condensed aromatic network. Apart from increased oxidation with age, ∼700 and 7000 yr old BC gave similar molecular fingerprints. The results contribute to our knowledge of the chemistry of BC, a potential climate mediator, and its fate in the terrestrial environment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Spectroscopic analysis (solid char and Py-WSOM) with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that the Py-WSOM extracted from two low temperature chars (one wood, one grass) was dominated by polar moieties (-OH and C-O) derived from depolymerization and fragmentation of lignocellulose. Incubation experiments under aerobic conditions with unsterilized river water suggested that Py-WSOM and associated biomarkers may have a turnover rate of the order of weeks to months, consistent with mixing and transport conditions of riverine systems. For example, pyrogenic dissolved organic carbon (Py-DOC) had a half-life of 30-40. days. Turnover rate for the combustion biomarkers was shorter, with levoglucosan and free lignin phenols having a half life around 3-4. days and polymeric lignin components 13-14. days. The latter observations contradict earlier studies of the biodegradation of dissolved lignin and point to the need for re-assessment of lignin degradation kinetics in well-mixed riverine systems, particularly when such lignin components are derived from thermally altered plant material that may exist in a form more labile than that in highly processed riverine DOM. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Aerobic condition; Aquatic system; Dissolved lignin; Dissolved organic carbon; Half lives; Levoglucosan; Lignin components; Lignin degradation; Lignin phenols; Low temperatures; Plant material; Polar moieties; River water; Riverine systems; Solid chars; Turnover rate; Water-soluble organic matter; Combustion; Degradation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Lignin; Microbiology; Phenols; Spectroscopic analysis; Temperature; Biodegradation; biodegradation; biomarker; charcoal; combustion; dissolved organic carbon; FTIR spectroscopy; lignin; low temperature; phenol; polymerization; wildfire","National Science Foundation, NSF: OCE-0959631

These two groups of biomarkers are often used as unique tracers of combusted biomass inputs in diverse environmental media. However, detailed characterization of the relative proportion and signatures of these compounds in highly heterogeneous plant-derived chars are still scarce. Here we conducted a systematic study to investigate the yields of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols in 25 lab-made chars produced from different plant materials under different combustion conditions. Solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols were only observed in chars formed below 350 °C and yields were variable across different combustion temperatures. The yields of mannosan (M) and galactosan (G) decreased more rapidly than those of levoglucosan (L) under increasing combustion severity (temperature and duration), resulting in variable L/M and L/(M. +. G) ratios, two diagnostic ratios often used for identification of combustion sources (e.g. hardwoods vs. softwoods vs. grasses). Our observations thus may provide an explanation for the wide ranges of values reported in the literature for these two ratios. On the other hand, the results of this study suggest that the ratios of the major solvent-extractable lignin phenols (vanillyls (V), syringyls (S), cinnamyls (C)) provide additional source reconstruction potential despite observed variations with combustion temperature. We thus propose using a property-property plot (L/M vs. S/V) as an improved means for source characterization of biomass combustion residues. The L/M-S/V plot has shown to be effective in environmental samples (soil organic matter, atmospheric aerosols) receiving substantial inputs of biomass combustion residues. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Anhydrosugars; Biomass combustion; Black carbon; Lignin phenols; Plant-derived chars","Anhydrosugars; Biomass combustion; Black carbon; Combustion condition; Combustion sources; Combustion temperatures; Diagnostic ratios; Environmental media; Environmental sample; Galactosan; Levoglucosan; Plant material; Plant-derived chars; Soil organic matters; Source characterization; Source reconstruction; Systematic study; Thermal degradations; Atmospheric aerosols; Biomass; Characterization; Degradation; Isomers; Lignin; Phenols; Solvents; Combustion; charcoal; galactosan; levoglucosan; lignin; mannosan; phenol; sugar; unclassified drug; aerosol; biomarker; biomass; black carbon; cellulose; charcoal; combustion; grass; lignin; literature review; phenol; reconstruction; soil organic matter; solvent; tracer; article; biomass; combustion; grass; temperature sensitivity; wood; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Heating; Lignin; Phenols; Plants; Solvents; Poaceae","Division of Ocean Sciences, OCE

Benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCA) are used as molecular markers to quantify and characterize BC in soils and sediments using gas chromatography for BPCA separation (GC-BPCA). Recently, this method was refined for BC analysis in seawater using high performance liquid chromatography (LC-BPCA), which omits the cleaning steps and derivatization necessary in GC analysis. As yet it is not clear whether the two analytical methods yield similar results. Here we apply both methods to a suite of laboratory produced charcoals derived from wood and grass. We found systematically lower total BPCA-C contents and larger analytical variability for all tested charcoals when using GC-BPCA compared to LC-BPCA, the latter giving 1.5 ± 0.3 times higher yields for the charcoal samples formed at 275-700 °C At lower and higher pyrolysis temperatures the differences between the two analytical methods were larger. The main reason for the differences between the two methods is the loss of BPCA during sample preparation for GC analysis. We propose a correction factor of 1.5 to account for at least part of these losses. No qualitative biases, i.e. towards more or less functionalized BPCAs, were observed between the two methods. The relative contribution of mellitic acid C to total BPCA-C, a measure for the degree of condensation of BC, was the same in the two analytical techniques. Qualitative differences between wood and grass charcoals as detected by both methods were small. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Analytical method; Analytical techniques; Analytical variability; Black carbon; Correction factors; Degree of condensation; Derivatizations; Existing method; Functionalized; Higher yield; Mellitic acid; Molecular marker; Molecular tracer; Pyrolysis temperature; Qualitative differences; Relative contribution; Sample preparation; Soils and sediments; Anoxic sediments; Charcoal; High performance liquid chromatography; Liquids; Petroleum refining; Pyrolysis; Seawater; Gas chromatography; black carbon; carboxylic acid; charcoal; comparative study; condensation; gas chromatography; grass; liquid chromatography; pyrolysis; quantitative analysis; seawater; tracer; wood","UniversitÃ¤t ZÃ¼rich, UZH","We would like to thank the Associate Editor Klaas G.J.

Often regarded as complementary techniques, solid state 13C NMR and Py-GC/MS are widely used for the characterisation of organic matter. Recently, a molecular mixing model (MMM) was proposed to predict the distribution of C in biochemical components (carbohydrate, protein, lignin, lipid, char) from the 13C NMR spectral distribution, thereby allowing a quantitative comparison with Py-GC/MS product abundances. We discuss the application of this model to a peat core, by comparing NMR-MMM results with Py-GC/MS data. The core represents ∼5000 yr accumulation and ranges from fibric (at the surface) to hemic (bottom). The amounts of carbohydrates and lipids predicted by the MMM and calculated from the quantified Py-GC/MS chromatograms are in close agreement. However, the well known low capability of the conventional Py-GC/MS method to provide structural information on proteins from bulk soils, the poor GC amenability of polar compounds and many other possible sources of inaccuracy in Py-GC/MS and NMR-MMM caused discrepancies with predictions made with the MMM. Also, the MMM failed to give good prediction of the C/N ratio of the peat material. Although the NMR-MMM approach does not account for molecular transitions during decomposition, this oversimplification proved to be acceptable. The MMM seems to be a useful tool for the interpretation of NMR spectral distributions in peat material. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Interpretation of these soil signatures, however, has generally been more problematic. One approach to the problem has been the use of ethnographic or ""known"" sites to guide interpretation, but how confidently can results from one site be extrapolated to another? This study of abandoned farms tests the site specificity of soil multi-element signatures of past space use through the use of discriminant models. Data analysis suggests that one to one comparisons of similar sites are much less accurate (38% accuracy) than comparisons based on a wider range of sites (59.3% accuracy), even when the latter have contrasting geology.

As expected, the impact is minimal for uncharred woods, but is very significant for the charred woods. Quantification of the decrease in CPMAS signal intensity caused by both inefficient cross polarization and rapid T1ρH relaxation is achieved using an advanced spin counting methodology, for which the term ""spin accounting"" is proposed. 13C CPMAS NMR observabilities determined using the spin accounting methodology were close to 100% for the uncharred samples, and 69-82% for the charred samples. This represents a large improvement on the 30-40% observabilities determined using other spin counting techniques.

The variability of LOP concentrations and signatures for all these materials averages 3-5% and does not exceed 10%. Using these standards, a new quantification method was developed and validated for the determination of low-level CuO oxidation products using capillary gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS-MS). Tandem mass spectrometry provides both the high sensitivity and selectivity required for the identification and quantification of trace levels of dissolved lignin. The method is particularly useful for removing interference from co-eluting isotopes generated from the DOM matrix and during glucose amendment procedures of low-carbon samples.

Pyrolysis-GC/MS, which provides structural information on complex mixtures of organic matter, was applied to the NaOH-extractable organic matter of an acidic colluvial soil (Atlantic ranker) sampled with high resolution (5 cm) that harbours a fire record of at least 8.5 ka. Additionally, 5 charcoal samples from selected soil layers were characterised using pyrolysis-GC/MS for comparison. Pyrolysis-GC/MS allowed distinguishing between BC and non-charred organic matter. It is argued that a large proportion of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzenes and benzonitrile in the pyrolysates of the extractable organic matter, together accounting for 21-54% of total identified peak area, derived from BC. In charcoal samples, these compounds accounted for 60-98% of the pyrolysis products. The large quantity of BC in almost all samples suggested a key role of fire in Holocene soil evolution. The high C content of the soil (up to 136 g C kg-1 soil) may be attributed to the presence of recalcitrant organic C as BC, in addition to the sorptive preservation processes traditionally held responsible for long-term C storage in acid soils. Interactions between reactive Al hydroxides and BC could explain the longevity of BC in the soil.

Levoglucosan concentrations were either seriously underestimated or overestimated with ethyl acetate extraction when d7-levoglucosan or sedoheptulosan was used as surrogate, respectively. These results point to the need to use some fraction of polar solvent (i.e. methanol) in the solvent mixture. Anhydrosugar concentrations in the urban dust from the Czech Republic (candidate SRMs 2786 and 2787) were characterized by 3- to 7-fold higher anhydrosugar concentrations than those observed in the Washington, D.C. urban dust. The internal anhydrosugar signatures (i.e. levoglucosan/mannosan ratio: L/M) confirm the predominance of biomass combustion sources in both SRM series with mixed inputs from hardwood and softwood combustion in the Washington, D.C. urban dust and a predominantly softwood source in the Prague urban dust. The uniform distribution of anhydrosugars, across the particle size distribution of both SRM series, confirms earlier studies that low temperature charred materials contribute significant inputs to atmospheric ultrafine particles with long atmospheric residence time and transport ranges. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosol standards; Anhydrosugars; Biomass combustion; Levoglucosan; Standard reference materials","Anhydrosugars; Biomass combustion; Levoglucosan; Standard reference material; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Biomass; Combustion; Concentration (process); Dust; Esters; Isomers; Methanol; Organic solvents; Reluctance motors; Smoke; Softwoods; Solvents; Standards; Extraction; acetic acid ethyl ester; carbohydrate derivative; levoglucosan; methanol; sedoheptulosan; unclassified drug; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; chemical composition; estimation method; extraction method; particle size; size distribution; standard (reference); aerosol; air analysis; air pollution; air quality standard; article; biomass; chemical analysis; combustion; concentration (parameters); controlled study; Czech Republic; dust; isotope labeling; low temperature; particle size; pollution transport; priority journal; reproducibility; solvent extraction; United States; Central Europe; Czech Republic; District of Columbia; Eurasia; Europe; North America; Prague; United States; Washington [District of Columbia]",,"We thank two anonymous reviewers whose comments greatly improved the manuscript.

The OR of the terrestrial biosphere must be well characterized to accurately estimate the terrestrial CO2 sink using atmospheric measurements of changing O2 and CO2 levels. To estimate the OR of the terrestrial biosphere, measurements are needed of changes in the OR of aboveground and belowground carbon pools associated with decadal timescale disturbances (e.g., land use change and fire). The OR of aboveground pools can be measured using conventional approaches including elemental analysis. However, measuring the OR of soil carbon pools is technically challenging, and few soil OR data are available. In this paper we test three solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for measuring soil OR, all based on measurements of the closely related parameter, organic carbon oxidation state (Cox). Two of the three techniques make use of a molecular mixing model which converts NMR spectra into concentrations of a standard suite of biological molecules of known C ox. The third technique assigns Cox values to each peak in the NMR spectrum. We assess error associated with each technique using pure chemical compounds and plant biomass standards whose Cox and OR values can be directly measured by elemental analyses. The most accurate technique, direct polarization solid-state 13C NMR with the molecular mixing model, agrees with elemental analyses to ±0.036 Cox units (±0.009 OR units). Using this technique, we show a large natural variability in soil Cox and OR values. Soil Cox values have a mean of -0.26 and a range from -0.45 to 0.30, corresponding to OR values of 1.08 ± 0.06 and a range from 0.96 to 1.22. We also estimate the OR of the carbon flux from a boreal forest fire. Analysis of soils from nearby intact soil profiles imply that soil carbon losses associated with the fire had an OR of 1.091 (±0.003). Fire appears to be a major factor driving the soil C pool to higher oxidation states and lower OR values. Episodic fluxes caused by disturbances like fire may have substantially different ORs from ecosystem respiration fluxes and therefore should be better quantified to reduce uncertainties associated with our understanding of the global atmospheric carbon budget.

Signatures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also used to support the historical reconstructions of BC to this system. Down-core maxima in GBC and combustion-derived PAHs occurred in the 1940s in the cores from the Puget Sound Main Basin, whereas in Hood Canal such peak was observed in the 1970s, showing basin-specific differences in inputs of combustion byproducts. This system showed relatively higher inputs from softwood combustion than the northeastern U.S. The historical variations in char-BC concentrations were consistent with shifts in climate indices, suggesting an influence of climate oscillations on wildfire events. Environmental loading of combustion byproducts thus appears as a complex function of urbanization, fuel usage, combustion technology, environmental policies, and climate conditions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The lignin oxidation products (LOPs), quantified using the alkaline cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation method, were used to study the impact of combustion on lignins and their commonly used parameters. Our results show that combustion can greatly decrease the yield of the eight major lignin phenols (vanillyl, syringyl and cinnamyl phenols) with no lignin phenols detected in any synthetic char produced at ≥ 400 °C. With increasing combustion temperature, the value of the syringyl/vanillyl phenols ratio (S/V) of angiosperm char initially increased but then declined dramatically when the temperature reached 200-250 °C. The pattern of change may relate to the thermal alteration of the plant cell ultrastructure. The cinnamyl/vanillyl phenols ratio value (C/V) of a non-woody plant, cordgrass, also showed a similar two-stage change with increasing combustion temperature. Combustion duration also caused a similar effect on the yield and signatures of lignin phenols, showing that the combustion severity (temperature and/or duration) has great influence on LOP yield and signature. The acid/aldehyde ratio of vanillyl phenols [(Ad/Al)v] and syringyl phenols [(Ad/Al)s] increased with increasing combustion temperature and duration and reached a maximum value at 300-350 °C, regardless of plant species. The highly elevated acid/aldehyde ratio value reached in some cases exceeded the reported values of humic and fulvic acids extracted from soils and sediments. Furthermore, the ratio of 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid to vanillyl phenols (3,5Bd/V), a soil humification indicator, increased significantly during combustion at 250-350 °C in char samples from all the plant species. Our results imply that changes in LOP signatures in chars can serve as potential indicators of their formation temperature. Simulations using a two end member mixing model showed that different char samples, with different degrees of lignin alteration, could have a substantial effect on the biomarker signatures of soil organic matter (SOM). The shifts in lignin signatures in SOM vary widely, depending on the SOM characteristics (e.g. soil litter vs. mineral soil) and the proportion of char in the mixture. Overall, the input of high temperature char tends to dilute the lignin signal in SOM and may lead to underestimation of vascular plant OM input to environmental matrices. Our observations demonstrate that, in addition to photochemical degradation, thermal alteration is an important abiotic lignin degradation process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Mounting evidence suggests that prehistoric human activities may have interfered with natural pedogenesis on a large scale. Therefore, we undertook to identify parameters that would enable researchers to infer a human interference with pedogenesis. We selected a soil with a known history of prehistoric influence (Seeben), later referred to as ancient soil, and a reference soil (Zöberitz) with properties representative of the chernozemic soils in the vicinity. We did a survey of parameters that are commonly used to characterize pedogenetic dynamics and combined this with an investigation of organic matter properties. We found that prehistoric land use has predominantly modified the properties of the subsoil, rendering it unlikely that such modifications are the result of either (i) contemporary agricultural management or (ii) natural input dynamics via root systems or bioturbation. Soil color was darker, bulk density higher, and C/N ratio wider in the ancient soil. The mineral matrix was uniform down to a depth of 95 cm in the ancient soil, whereas a B-horizon with a corresponding change in clay mineral assemblage was developed in the reference soil. Compared with the reference soil, the carbon stock was elevated by a factor of 2.5 in the ancient soil, with more carbon associated with the clay fraction. We identified large contributions of charred organic matter in the ancient soil by two independent methods (Benzene polycarboxylic acid BPCA; Transmission electron microscopy, TEM), and confirmed by means of solid-state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning/nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-CP-MAS-NMR) spectroscopy that organic matter aromaticity was higher in the ancient soil. We suggest that any simultaneous occurrence of several of the observations listed above should be regarded as a strong indication for human interference with soil genesis.","Benzenecarboxylic acids; Charred organic carbon; Pedogenesis; Prehistoric land use; Solid state 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction","anthropogenic effect; Chernozem; land use; pedogenesis; prehistoric; soil carbon; Germany",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242584431

Most studies focus on the refractory end of the PyC spectrum, derived from middle- to high-temperature combustion. Low-temperature PyC is produced during wildfires and has been found to be particularly labile and water soluble. Here we find that in each of the major Siberian watersheds, low-temperature fire-derived biomarkers are present in detectable concentrations during all flow regimes of the 2004-2006 sampling period, confirming that PyC is an intrinsic component of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool mobilized by hydrologic events. Gymnosperm combustion, from the southern portions of these watersheds, is the primary source of this Py-DOC input. Using first-order degradation rates and transit times of water through these rivers, about half of the total estimated flux of this material may be remineralized during transport from fire source to river mouth (20-40-days), demonstrating the input of a labile source of PyC to these watersheds. © 2015.

The composition of the n-alkanes and n-fatty acids (FA) as well as the contents of the molecular markers levoglucosan and vanillin were determined and related to charring intensity and stability to microbial reworking. Our results confirmed that charring of plant residues results in typical thermal breakdown processes of n-alkanes and FA. Prolonged charring reduced the average chain length of n-alkanes by up to four carbons and shifted the characteristic odd/even predominance of fresh plants towards a balanced odd/even distribution. The unsaturated FA fraction was more prone to heat degradation than the saturated counterparts. Especially, linoleic acid (C18:2) and α-linolenic acid (C18:3) were depleted in the severely charred grass, whereas oleic acid (C18:1) was still present. Levoglucosan was detectable in all PyOMs, but the pine wood charred for 1min (P1M) contained the largest amount. Progressive heating resulted in a strong depletion of levoglucosan for both plant materials. The pine char showed a relative accumulation of vanillin, supporting that some lignin-derived structures can survive charring. Microbial decomposition of the chars within a soil matrix for seven weeks demonstrates that during initial PyOM biodegradation, n-alkanes and FA series are rapidly modified by microbial reworking and biosynthesis. After the incubation, the pine chars were enriched in octadecane (C18) and homologues in the range from C22 to C26. The n-alkanes and FA of the grass chars were more severely affected than those of the pine chars. Levoglucosan was efficiently decomposed, indicating that care has to be taken if these compounds are used as char tracer in soils, since their instability against biodegradation may hamper the identification of charcoal residues. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon degradation; Levoglucosan; Lipids; Plant chars; Rye grass; Scots pine","Black carbon; Levoglucosan; Plant chars; Rye grass; Scots pine; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Charcoal; Forestry; Linoleic acid; Lipids; Microbiology; Oleic acid; Organic compounds; Paraffins; Plants (botany); Soils; Biodegradation; biochemistry; biodegradation; biomarker; black carbon; charcoal; coniferous tree; decomposition; grass; microbial activity; organic compound; oxic conditions; reworking; soil organic matter; thermal decomposition; tracer; Alkanes; Biodegradation; Carbon; Char; Charcoal; Forestry; Linoleic Acid; Lipids; Microbiology; Oleic Acid; Organic Compounds; Pinus Sylvestris; Plants; Soil; Lolium perenne; Pinus sylvestris; Secale cereale","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN

Various pits and a ditch found in the area are distinct from the surrounding loamy soil because of the dark brown color of their filling materials. Although several artifacts have been discovered, at the present stage of research neither the nature of the filling material nor the function of pits and the ditch are well understood. Thus, the organic matter composition of 30 filling layers from 11 Neolithic pits found in this settlement was investigated and compared with that of a nearby Luvisol profile and two A horizons from contemporary Phaeozems. All samples were subjected to C and N analysis, soil lightness measurements, solid-state 13C CPMAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and polysaccharide and lignin analysis. The organic carbon contents are higher in the Neolithic samples than in the Luvisol horizons, but they are generally lower than in the A horizons of contemporary phaeozemic soils developed from loess. The Neolithic samples have a much higher intensity in darkness than do the surrounding Luvisol horizons. The organic carbon content of the Neolithic samples correlates with the lightness value. Solid-state 13C NMR measurements revealed that this correlation is primarily because of their aromatic C content, which is considerably higher in the Neolithic samples than in the contemporary soils. Small polysaccharide amounts and no lignin-derived phenols were found in the Neolithic samples. Thus, the organic material filling the Neolithic pits is significantly different in overall chemical composition from the surrounding soil. It represents a highly altered, highly aromatic material showing no evidence of lignin degradation products and probably deriving from non-soil origins.","Filling matrix; Lignin degradation products; Neolithic pits; Polysaccharide amounts; Soil color; Soil lightness measurements; Solid-state 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy","chemical composition; fill; Neolithic; nuclear magnetic resonance; organic matter; paleosol; Germany",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034756649

This study discusses the relationship of soil chemical elements and middens at Group Chispa, a Late Classic residential complex at a commoner village in the Maya lowlands. The complex was extensively excavated and soil sampled. Ceramic sherd densities, which serve as a proxy for artifact densities, correlate only partially with phosphorus and other chemical elements. One of the three middens in Group Chispa coincides with the highest concentration of P while the two others-including the most extensive one-have medium to low P levels. A spectrum of human activities that include the preparation of pigments explains the nontraditional distribution of chemical elements. High P levels remain useful to detect middens but they provide an incomplete picture and need to be contextualized by comprehensive archaeological data. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864812826

This study combines ethnoarchaeological observations of midden formation and disturbance in Dalupa with data from soils and sediments in natural, habitation, and midden contexts, including elemental data for 80 samples collected using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy. Most surface samples from habitation areas cluster with midden samples, although samples from the lower parts of theses profiles resemble samples from natural contexts around Dalupa. One explanation is a changing spatial distribution of active middens due to changes in house placement and occupation in Dalupa's history. Some habitation areas that chemically resemble middens may once have held middens, as suggested by the periodic changes in midden location from the cleaning and management of extramural space. Surface scatters of human and animal refuse throughout the habitation area may also contribute to this pattern. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247111530

Smith 1995). The knowledge gained about the native American past in the region, about the challenges faced during times of prehistoric cultural change, and during the wrenching episode (still ongoing) of contact and interaction between the Caddo peoples and European and Anglo- American colonizers and settlers (Perttula 1998b) helps to make ""native history"" an integral part of-rather than a footnote to-the ongoing study of Texas' cultural heritage. While there is every reason to think that our knowledge of northeastern Texas prehistory will continue to grow by leaps and bounds, there are tremendous research and preservation challenges ahead for each prehistoric era. On a mundane level, it is important that we continually cast a critical and discerning eye at our research priorities for prehistoric and Caddoan archeological sites, the value of our methodological approaches, and the worth of our cultural resource management planning documents. From the innovative use of these tools come the new perspectives and conceptions that lead to a broader understanding of the past. Changes in research strategies are critical, but in northeastern Texas they are, unfortunately, only part of the archeological story. Of the utmost concern for the long-term protection and preservation of the region's priceless archeological heritage is dealing directly with the unabated looting and vandalism of prehistoric Caddo villages and cemeteries-on private as well as state and federal lands (Perttula and Nelson 1999). The archeological landscape is pitted and pocked with the looter's holes and backdirt piles. Many of the most important archeological sites in the region have been irretrievably damaged and destroyed, and it is questionable that the looting frenzy can be quelled even should an unmarked burial protection bill ever be made law in Texas; the situation is not much better in Arkansas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. The cultural patrimony of the Caddo peoples is being taken from them, with almost no hand being lifted to help protect these significant cultural treasures. This challenge is our greatest in the years ahead: to find a way, in concert with the Caddo people, to protect and preserve this cultural legacy: ""In 1541 when the Spaniards arrived, every place in the Caddo country had, of course, a Caddo name but almost all of those names are gone now, like the people who bestowed them"" (Schambach 1993, 7).
