white-rot and brown-rot fungi. P. tremellosus caused progressive weight losses and increased the H/C and O/C of the remnant wood by preferentially degrading the lignin component of the middle lamellae. This fungus increased the absolute (weight loss-corrected) yield of the vanillic acid CuO reaction product above its initial level and exponentially decreased the absolute yields of all other lignin-derived phenols. Total yields of syringyl phenols were decreased 1.5 times as fast as total vanillyl phenol yields. Within both phenol families, aldehyde precursors were degraded faster than precursors of the corresponding ketones, which were obtained in constant proportion to the total phenol yield. Although two other white-rot fungi caused similar lignin compositional trends, a fourth white-rot species, Coriolus versicolor, simultaneously eroded all cell wall components and did not concentrate polysaccharides in the remnant wood. Wood degraded by the three brown-rot fungi exhibited porous cell walls with greatly reduced integrity. The brown-rot fungi also preferentially attacked syringyl structural units, but degraded all phenol precursors at a much slower rate than the white-rotters and did not produce excess vanillic acid. Degradation by P. tremellosus linearly increased the vanillic acid/vanillin ratio, (Ad/Al)v, of the remnant birch wood throughout the 12 week degradation study and exponentially decreased the absolute yields of total vanillyl phenols, total syringyl phenols and the syringyl/vanillyl phenol ratio, S/V. At the highest (Ad/Al)v of 0.50 (12 week samples), total yields of syringyl and vanillyl phenols were decreased by 65% and 80%, respectively, with a resulting reduction of 40% in the original S/V. Many of the diagenetically related compositional trends that have been previously reported for lignins in natural environments can be explained by white-rot fungal degradation. © 1988.","source":"Scopus","title":"Effects of fungal degradation on the CuO oxidation products of lignin: A controlled laboratory study","volume":"52","page start":"2717","author(s) id":"7102918984;7004254875;6506391640;7003629650;","document type":"Article","cited by":"346","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Hedges J.I., Blanchette R.A., Weliky K., Devol A.H.","doi":"10.1016/0016-7037(88)90040-3"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":579.9955444335938,"y":-2428.635498046875,"id":"585","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84906660285","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1902","page end":"100","source title":"A Report on the Geology of Louisiana","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The salines of North Louisiana","page start":"47","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bayliss A.","x":-778.4927978515625,"y":324.9822998046875,"id":"602","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-78049289193","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"1","year":"2009","page end":"147","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-78049289193\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2fS0033822200033750\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d570ddd45090043c5fd094e14bd6cc67b","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Radiocarbon","abstract":"Sixty years ago, the advent of radiocarbon dating rewrote archaeological chronologies around the world.

First, a cluster of dates between about cal A.D. 1250 and 1450 that are temporally concentrated but spatially widespread suggests a relatively sudden increase in the archaeological visibility of maize in New England at this time. The increase in visibility roughly coincides with an increase in maize consumption in the midcontinent, although further studies are needed to clarify the liming of the latter. Second and even more striking is the simultaneous increase in the archaeological visibility of beans as well as maize in New England during the same period.

The concept\u0027 which has its roots in the intensely productive decade of the 1930s\u0027 has a history that is both as long as and fundamentally tied to yet another venerable concept in southeastern archaeology: Mississippian. In 1984\u0027 as it is today\u0027 it was clear that our understanding of the objects\u0027 themes\u0027 and artistic styles associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) has changed a great deal\u0027 and it is equally clear that this complex is much more complex than once thought. Since the publishing of The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex: Artifacts and Analysis\u0027 new primary data have come to light that bear directly on the complex\u0027 and new theoretical approaches have continued to ask us to view it in new ways. Also in that time\u0027 Jeffrey P. Brain and Philip Phillips (1996) published a major work on engraved shell gorget styles\u0027 which has reignited many debates about the dating and nature of the SECC and reinvigorated studies of the complex. Given the circumstances\u0027 the contributors to this volume saw that the time was right to bring together and present these new data and perspectives on the SECC. The purpose here is not to present a single\u0027 unified conception of the SECC but rather to present new data and new ideas on the temporal and social contexts of the objects\u0027 artistic styles\u0027 and symbolic themes included in the complex. In fact\u0027 it will become clear that there is no single\u0027 unified perspective on the meaning\u0027 function\u0027 or content of the SECC precisely because the SECC was not a single\u0027 monolithic ceremonial complex\u0027 artistic tradition\u0027 or belief system. Despite this\u0027 for simplicity\u0027s sake I will continue to refer to this complex as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex or SECC. The purpose of this chapter is to create a context for the contributions that follow by briefl y reviewing the development of our conceptions of the SECC and the research that it has engendered. I organize this review around a series of publications that I consider to be watershed contributions in the history of the SECC. The reader is referred to Brown (2001a)\u0027 Brown and Kelly (2000)\u0027 Galloway (1989)\u0027 and Williams (1968) for other fine reviews of the development of the SECC.

As expected, the impact is minimal for uncharred woods, but is very significant for the charred woods. Quantification of the decrease in CPMAS signal intensity caused by both inefficient cross polarization and rapid T1ρH relaxation is achieved using an advanced spin counting methodology, for which the term \"spin accounting\" is proposed. 13C CPMAS NMR observabilities determined using the spin accounting methodology were close to 100% for the uncharred samples, and 69-82% for the charred samples. This represents a large improvement on the 30-40% observabilities determined using other spin counting techniques.

We consider the time period of ca. 46,000 to 12,000 B.P. for which we have assembled and critically studied 437 radiocarbon dates. All dates from individual sites that fall within 1,000 14C years are considered as a single event and called occupation episode. The results of our analysis show that the number of 14C dates until ca. 28,000 B.P. is small and increases at ca. 28,000-20,000 B.P., and dates decrease in frequency for the ca. 20,000-16,000 B.P. time range. It is after ca. 16,000 B.P. that we see a substantial rise in the number of 14C dates. In terms of the relative size of Siberian Paleolithic populations based on the frequency of occupation episodes, population density was small until ca. 36,000 B.P. Subsequently, population size increased gradually at ca. 36,000-16,000 B.P., and the growth rate became almost exponential at ca. 16,000-12,000 B.P. The number of occupations from ca. 20,000 to 18,000 B.P. did not decrease, running counter to arguments that Siberia was completely or considerably depopulated during the Last Glacial Maximum.

A comparison of Etowali\u0027s history to the developmental sequences of two other major Mississippian mound centers, Moundville and Cahokia, shows that Etowah developed within a region where it was difficult to establish the same long-term political dominance attained by Cahokia and Moundville. Individual Mississippian centers were parts of larger regions with distinct ecological and social histories. This comparison also indicates that Etowah\u0027s political economy was oriented along individual-centered or network principles during its rise to power ca. AD 1300, while the political economies of Moundville and Cahokia focused on group-oriented or corporate principles during their periods of political ascendance ca. AD 2050-1200. This suggests that there were temporal and regional differences in the orientation of Mississippian political economies.","source":"Scopus","title":"Long-term histories of Mississippian centers: The developmental sequence of Etowah and its comparison to Moundville and Cahokia","volume":"20","page start":"1","author(s) id":"37018942800;","document type":"Review","cited by":"26","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"King A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Emerson T.E., Hughes R.E., Hynes M.R., Wisseman S.U.","x":-445.4981994628906,"y":-696.6903686523438,"id":"839","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-1842545647","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2003","page end":"313","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-1842545647\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f3557081\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dfc3e0df2284d42a9b8305ce9dae75c3c","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Exchange of preciosities is often considered an integral factor in the emergence of Mississippian chiefdoms, and the rise of Cahokia has been linked to such long-distance trade. We know that Cahokia was the center of production for large flint clay figurines and effigy pipes (Emerson and Hughes 2000). Similar Cahokia-style figures have been found in the Trans-Mississippi South and the Southeast. We investigated the material used to make these figures using a newly developed nondestructive PIMA SP™ spectroscopic technology to identify the stone and to determine their source location. These analyses proved that the figures were made of Missouri flint clay from quarries near St. Louis. We submit that Cahokia was the twelfth-century source for the production of these Cahokia-style figures. Outside of Cahokia the flint clay figures were primarily found in Caddoan mortuaries, reinforcing earlier evidence of a strong Cahokia-Caddoan connection. The available chronological and contextual information indicates the flint clay figures left Cahokia after it began to decline in the late thirteenth-century, through various mechanisms of extra-local exchange rather than as part of any systematic prestige-goods network. The association of these highly symbolic figures with Cahokia allows us to reevaluate the indigenous iconography and propose that many of the themes (e.g., fertility and warfare) that later appear in Eastern Woodlands native cosmology such as the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex were first codified here in the twelfth-century.

As a consequence, the natural abundance of aged and degraded BC is unknown. We carried out a molecular characterisation of up to ∼7000 yr old charcoal and NaOH-extractable SOM obtained from a colluvial soil in NW Spain using Curie point pyrolysis-GC/MS and THM. Black C was tentatively quantified using solid state 13C CP and DP NMR in conjunction with a molecular mixing model (MMM), and the use of BPCAs. Not surprisingly, the charcoal consisted for the most part of chemically distinctive BC moieties, as concluded from CP and DP NMR-MMM (\u0026gt;72% BC-inherent C) and the BPCA method (30-40%). Charcoal produced mainly benzene, toluene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) upon pyrolysis and THM. The SOM was a mixture of BC-derived (producing benzene, toluene, PAHs and benzonitrile on pyrolysis) and non-BC lipid, carbohydrate and protein-derived OM. Benzenes, PAHs and benzonitrile accounted for 41-54% (pyrolysis-GC/MS) and 34-58% (THM) of total identified peak area in extractable SOM, comparable with the 32-41% BC obtained using DP NMR-MMM. Combined results suggested that the SOM BC was a partially oxidised, N-containing, weakly condensed aromatic network. Apart from increased oxidation with age, ∼700 and 7000 yr old BC gave similar molecular fingerprints. The results contribute to our knowledge of the chemistry of BC, a potential climate mediator, and its fate in the terrestrial environment. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This organic matter is analyzed as solvent extractable bitumen/lipids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The organic geochemical approach assesses the origin, the environmental history and the nature of secondary products of organic matter by using the data derived from specific molecular analyses. Evaluations of production and fluxes, with cross-correlations can thus be made by the application of the same separation and analytical procedures to samples from point source emissions and the ambient atmosphere. This will be illustrated here with typical examples from the ambient atmosphere (aerosol particles) and from emissions of biomass burning (smoke). Organic matter in aerosols is derived from two major sources and is admixed depending on the geographic relief of the air shed. These sources are biogenic detritus (e.g., plant wax, microbes, etc.) and anthropogenic particle emissions (e.g., oils, soot, synthetics, etc.). Both biogenic detritus and some of the anthropogenic particle emissions contain organic materials which have unique and distinguishable compound distribution patterns (C14-C40). Microbial and vascular plant lipids are the dominant biogenic residues and petroleum hydrocarbons, with lesser amounts of the pyrogenic polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and synthetics (e.g., chlorinated compounds), are the major anthropogenic residues. Biomass combustion is another important primary source of particles injected into the global atmosphere. It contributes many trace substances which are reactants in atmospheric chemistry and soot particulate matter with adsorbed biomarker compounds, most of which are unknown chemical structures. The injection of natural product organic compounds into smoke occurs primarily by direct volatilization/steam stripping and by thermal alteration based on combustion temperature. Although the molecular composition of organic matter in smoke particles is highly variable, the molecular tracers are generally still source specific. Retene has been utilized as a tracer for conifer smoke in urban aerosols, but is not always detectable. Dehydroabietic acid is generally more concentrated in the atmosphere from the same emission sources. Degradation products from biopolymers (e.g., levoglucosan from cellulose) are also excellent tracers. An overview of the biomarker compositions of biomass smoke types is presented here. Defining additional tracers of thermally-altered and directly-emitted natural products in smoke aids the assessment of the organic matter type and input from biomass combustion to aerosols. The precursor to product approach of compound characterization by organic geochemistry can be applied successfully to provide tracers for studying the chemistry and dispersion of ambient aerosols and smoke plumes.","source":"Scopus","title":"A review of biomarker compounds as source indicators and tracers for air pollution","funding text 1":"Partial funding of this work by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Grant CR 823990-01-0) is gratefully acknowledged.

Paleoarchaic peoples are described as highly mobile, focused on a diversity of animal resources, including birds and small game, and using more exotic toolstone, an aspect of mobility. In contrast, Early Archaic strategies are less mobile, yet more focused on large game, using more local toolstone, and adopting grinding tools presumably to process small seeds. Accompanying this transition is the shift from stemmed to notched projectile points. Data bearing on this transition on the Colorado Plateau have been scarce. Excavations of finely stratified deposits at North Creek Shelter on the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah have yielded support for the adaptive discontinuity position, although qualitative differences between the Great llasin and Colorado Plateau are apparent in mobility and faunal use.","source":"Scopus","title":"The Paleoarchaic to Early Archaic transition on the Colorado Plateau: The archaeology of North Creek Shelter","volume":"77","page start":"125","author(s) id":"6506709945;56147364300;56147485500;56147568800;","document type":"Article","cited by":"13","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Janetski J.C., Bodily M.L., Newbold B.A., Yoder D.T.","doi":"10.7183/0002-7316.77.1.125"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Schiffer M.B.","x":-12.458148002624512,"y":-181.9637451171875,"id":"1020","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003717184","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1987","cited by":"1157","source title":"Formation Processes of the Archaeological Record","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Schiffer M.B."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":346.043212890625,"y":-1026.5806884765625,"id":"1117","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649314669","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bolton H.E.","x":-796.0933227539062,"y":-711.6358032226562,"id":"1470","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0040266079","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1987","cited by":"26","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Hasinais: Southern Caddoans As Seen by the Earliest Europeans","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00298804780876494","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Bolton H.E."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Michczyńska D.J., Pazdur A.","x":-796.4931030273438,"y":270.6072998046875,"id":"612","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-4644302177","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"2","year":"2004","page end":"744","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-4644302177\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2fS0033822200035773\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d7f7fe8f7d4457968ec64580f9f1f6feb","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Radiocarbon","abstract":"We report on a statistical analysis of a large set of radiocarbon dates for reconstruction of pateoclimate.

We quantified how many dates are required to give statistically reliable results. As an example, 785 peat dates from Poland were selected. The dates encompassed the Holocene and Late Glacial period. All dates came from the Gliwice Radiocarbon Laboratory. Results were compared with other paleoenvironmental records. Detailed analysis of the frequency distributions showed that preferential sampling plays an important part in the shape determination.

While this assumption is certainly correct, we question whether relative frequencies of sites or dates observed from prehistoric contexts are necessarily linked to human demography. In this paper, we demonstrate that the typical positive curvilinear frequency distributions observed in archaeological contexts also regularly occur in paleontological and geological contexts and are thus likely caused by the operation of time-dependent destructive processes, what we call \"taphonomic bias.\" Using a simple model, which assumes a constant rate of site loss over time, we show how taphonomic bias can produce positive curvilinear frequency distributions through time even in cases of population stasis, decline, and fluctuation. We conclude that caution must be used when attempting to infer demographic trends from frequency distributions alone. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We combine mineralogical and INAA chemical compositional datasets to argue for at least three production provenances; we further argue that nine potential petrofacies represent different resource procurement zones within the production provenances. We argue that these data, combined, represent a minimum of three different communities of practice. Despite multiple communities of practice, similar designs were being used as decoration that reflects a single community of identity.

However, comparisons of the strength of integration across datasets are difficult, in part because the summary measures that characterize these patterns (RV coefficient and rPLS) are dependent both on sample size and on the number of variables. As a solution to this issue, we propose a standardized test statistic (a z-score) for measuring the degree of morphological integration between sets of variables. The approach is based on a partial least squares analysis of trait covariation, and its permutation-based sampling distribution. Under the null hypothesis of a random association of variables, the method displays a constant expected value and confidence intervals for datasets of differing sample sizes and variable number, thereby providing a consistent measure of integration suitable for comparisons across datasets. A two-sample test is also proposed to statistically determine whether levels of integration differ between datasets, and an empirical example examining cranial shape integration in Mediterranean wall lizards illustrates its use. Some extensions of the procedure are also discussed. © 2016 The Author(s).

A landscape-based geomagnetic survey of Mounds B, C, D, and the surrounding area offers a preliminary distributional view of architectural features and their proposed functions, which hint at the importance of the site as a paramount mound complex associated with ritual mortuary events linking regional supporting populations. Mound-top enclosures and off-mound rectangular and possible circular structures are clearly evident in the geomagnetic data and are interpreted as large rectangular-shaped mound structures or enclosures that likely represent specialized use associated with mortuary ritual and architecture, two rectangular and one circular structure associated xuith the interior of a charnel house structure, and one circular and 12 rectangular off-mound structures associated with a possible centralized plaza space. Results demonstrate that a complex prehistoric settlement existed at the Collins site with the presence of subsurface archaeological features associated with Mounds B, C, and D, and throughout the off-mound survey areas.","source":"Scopus","title":"The collins site (3WA1): Exploring architectural variation in the Western Ozark Highlands","volume":"32","page start":"70","author(s) id":"55840121100;35768195300;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; architectural design; geomagnetic field; geophysical survey; Mississippian; prehistoric; Ozark Mountains; United States; White River [United States]","document type":"Conference Paper","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Sullivan S.M., McKinnon D.P.","doi":"10.1179/sea.2013.32.1.006"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Gaffney C.F., Gater J.A., Linford P., Gaffney V.L., White R.","x":-164.34011840820312,"y":446.1941833496094,"id":"951","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0005583285","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2000","page end":"99","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0005583285\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2f1099-0763%28200006%297%3a2%3c81%3a%3aAID-ARP145%3e3.3.CO%3b2-Y\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d647abf850771d4faefbf866d50dc8385","source title":"Archaeological Prospection","abstract":"Over a number of field sessions, the Roman city of Wroxeter was surveyed using fluxgate gradiometers.

The composition of the n-alkanes and n-fatty acids (FA) as well as the contents of the molecular markers levoglucosan and vanillin were determined and related to charring intensity and stability to microbial reworking. Our results confirmed that charring of plant residues results in typical thermal breakdown processes of n-alkanes and FA. Prolonged charring reduced the average chain length of n-alkanes by up to four carbons and shifted the characteristic odd/even predominance of fresh plants towards a balanced odd/even distribution. The unsaturated FA fraction was more prone to heat degradation than the saturated counterparts. Especially, linoleic acid (C18:2) and α-linolenic acid (C18:3) were depleted in the severely charred grass, whereas oleic acid (C18:1) was still present. Levoglucosan was detectable in all PyOMs, but the pine wood charred for 1min (P1M) contained the largest amount. Progressive heating resulted in a strong depletion of levoglucosan for both plant materials. The pine char showed a relative accumulation of vanillin, supporting that some lignin-derived structures can survive charring. Microbial decomposition of the chars within a soil matrix for seven weeks demonstrates that during initial PyOM biodegradation, n-alkanes and FA series are rapidly modified by microbial reworking and biosynthesis. After the incubation, the pine chars were enriched in octadecane (C18) and homologues in the range from C22 to C26.

As the field of statistics developed, so have the sophistication of the analysis of these types of data. This lead to multivariate morphometrics in which suites of measurements were analyzed together using canonical variates analysis, principal components analysis, and related methods. In the 1980s, a fundamental change began in the nature of the data gathered and analyzed. This change focused on the coordinates of landmarks and the geometric information about their relative positions. As a by-product of such an approach, results of multivariate analyses could be visualized as configurations of landmarks back in the original space of the organism rather than only as statistical scatter plots. This new approach, called “geometric morphometrics”;, had benefits that lead Rohlf and Marcus (1993) to proclaim a “revolution”; in morphometrics. In this paper, we briefly update the discussion in that paper and summarize the advances in the ten years since the paper by Rohlf and Marcus.

Thus, exploring variability on the original designs can be informative of cultural adaptive processes on past populations. However, the complex life-cycle of a stone tool includes loops of damage due to use followed by breakage and resharpening that dramatically blur the size and shape attributes defining the original design. Here we use the Factor Model, a statistical approach recently modified to be used in landmark data, to evaluate original design attributes versus changes attributed to maintenance activities on a sample of Southern Patagonia lithic stemmed points, including arrows and spears. The model enables the separation of shape aspects that tend to covary because of common factors affecting simultaneously the two fundamental modules of a classical stemmed weapon (blade/stem), from those shape features explained only by local factors affecting modules independently. Our results show that original design differences explain most of the total shape variation, and also indicate that maintenance patterns differ among point types considered as different weapon systems (arrows and spears). Whereas arrow reduction is focused on tip modifications, spears present a broader array of shape changes including the tip and the shoulders. These results demonstrate that disentangling the sophisticated interaction among original design and maintenance activities of lithic projectile points enables a proper and independent exploration of adaptation to functional demands and cognitive models of past populations.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Identifying design and reduction effects on lithic projectile point shapes","funding text 1":"Sample points used in this study were surveyed thanks to funding from projects PICT-ANPCyT N° 15 , UBACyT 20020100100957 , PIP-CONICET 112-200801-00589 , PICT-ANPCyT N° 2046 , PIP-CONICET N° 5676 , and PICT-ANPCyT N° 04-9498 .

The proportion of maize in the diet of a human can therefore be estimated from the 13C-content of collagen of fossil bone. We have used this method to follow the increase in consumption of maize in ancient native populations over the interval from AD 400 to 1650, and to quantify the amount of maize consumed. Maize consumption rose gradually to a maximum of 50% of the diet by AD 1400. These data agree with archaeologically derived data for this region, and with previous isotope studies in the northeastern U.S.A. In some of the latter, however, the maximum percentage of maize consumed has been overestimated because maize was assumed to have a δ13C value of -12·5‰; our studies of archaeological specimens show the correct value to be closer to -9‰. The introduction of beans into the native diet about AD 1100, should have caused a decrease in the 15N content of human bone collagen because legumes are deficient in this isotope, with respect to meat and fish. However, we observe no significant change in the 15N14N ratio of human bone collagen over the period from 2300 BC to AD 1640. We conclude that meat and fish remained the main sources of protein even after the advent of agriculture into this region. © 1985.","source":"Scopus","title":"Stable isotopes in human skeletons of Southern Ontario: reconstructing Palaeodiet","funding text 1":"Acknowledgements This research was supported by a grant to Melbye and Schwartz from the Ontario Heritage Foundation.

In this paper, we use more than 25,000 radiocarbon dates extracted from the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database (CARD) to estimate long-term population trends in North America, while critically examining biases in such records. The frequency distribution of CARD dates shows a positive curvilinear pattern, such that older dates exist in lower numbers than more recent dates, which in part reflects the removal of cultural carbon from the archaeological record through processes such as erosion and dissolution. The average annual growth rate of radiocarbon dates in CARD was calculated and used to derive estimates of the population of North America from the Paleo-Indian to the Contact Periods. While taphonomic bias has likely affected the CARD data, other factors, such as the overrepresentation of Paleo-Indian and Archaic radiocarbon dates, may have offset any bias due to taphonomy. A quantitative reconstruction of Native American population shows that population increased rapidly around 2000 cal yr BP, reaching a maximum of 2,500,000 people by ∼AD 1150. From this time until European contact, the population declined, possibly due to the effects of increased sedentism and population density. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Isotope analysis of 185 collagen samples drawn from early prehistoric, late prehistoric, and contact-period mortuary sites encompasses two major adaptive shifts in the region, namely the adoption of maize agriculture in late prehistory and the increased emphasis on maize during the mission period. Prior to European contact - and especially before the establishment of Spanish missions among the Guale, Yamasee, Timucua, and Apalachee tribal groups - diet was strongly influenced by local environmental factors. Before contact, coastal and inland populations had different patterns of food consumption, as did populations living in Georgia and Florida. Coastal populations consumed more marine and less terrestrial foods than inland populations. In general, maize was adopted during the eleventh century A.D. by virtually all Georgia populations. However, with the exception of the Lake Jackson site, a major Mississippian center in northern Florida, Florida populations show little use of maize before contact. Following European contact, maize became widespread, regardless of location or habitat within the broad region of Spanish Florida. Missionization appears to have been an important factor in the convergence of native diets toward agriculture and away from foraging. This increased emphasis on maize contributed to a decline in quality of life for native populations.

Recent discussion has centered on issues of comparability between handaxes from eastern Asian and \u0027Acheulean\u0027 examples from western portions of the Old World. Here, we present a multivariate morphometric analysis in order to more fully document how Mid-Pleistocene (i.e. ~803 Kyr) handaxes from Bose Basin, China compare to examples from the west, as well as with additional (Mode 1) cores from across the Old World. Results show that handaxes from both the western Old World and Bose are significantly different from the Mode 1 cores, suggesting a gross comparability with regard to functionally-related form. Results also demonstrate overlap between the ranges of shape variation in Acheulean handaxes and those from Bose, demonstrating that neither raw material nor cognitive factors were an absolute impediment to Bose hominins in making comparable handaxe forms to their hominin kin west of the Movius Line. However, the shapes of western handaxes are different from the Bose examples to a statistically significant degree. Moreover, the handaxe assemblages from the western Old World are all more similar to each other than any individual assemblage is to the Bose handaxes. Variation in handaxe form is also comparatively high for the Bose material, consistent with suggestions that they represent an emergent, convergent instance of handaxe technology authored by Pleistocene hominins with cognitive capacities directly comparable to those of \u0027Acheulean\u0027 hominins. © 2012 Wang et al.","source":"Scopus","title":"Comparison of handaxes from Bose Basin (china) and the western Acheulean indicates convergence of form, not cognitive differences","volume":"7","author(s) id":"56920780300;9434693200;23471109300;35208537700;36602128100;","index keywords":"article; artifact; China; cognition; controlled study; cultural anthropology; geometry; handaxe; Middle Pleistocene; morphometrics; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; Stone Age; animal; archeology; cluster analysis; cognition; comparative study; history; hominid; multivariate analysis; nonparametric test; psychological aspect; tool use; Animals; Archaeology; China; Cluster Analysis; Cognition; History, Ancient; Hominidae; Multivariate Analysis; Principal Component Analysis; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tool Use Behavior","document type":"Article","cited by":"51","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e35804","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Wang W., Lycett S.J., von Cramon-Taubadel N., Jin J.J.H., Bae C.J.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0035804"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Baldock J.A., Oades J.M., Nelson P.N., Skene T.M., Golchir A., Clarke P.","x":-1878.2891845703125,"y":2237.8076171875,"id":"284","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0030826389","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"5","year":"1997","page end":"1083","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0030826389\u0026doi\u003d10.1071%2fS97004\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d345ce6c1fc5c742b04a8d05baffc579b","source title":"Australian Journal of Soil Research","abstract":"Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has become an important tool for examining the chemical structure of natural organic materials and the chemical changes associated with decomposition. In this paper, solid-state 13C NMR data pertaining to changes in the chemical composition of a diverse range of natural organic materials, including wood, peat, composts, forest litter layers, and organic materials in surface layers of mineral soils, were reviewed with the objective of deriving an index of the extent of decomposition of such organic materials based on changes in chemical composition. Chemical changes associated with the decomposition of wood varied considerably and were dependent on a strong interaction between the species of wood examined and the species composition of the microbial decomposer community, making the derivation of a single general index applicable to wood decomposition unlikely. For the remaining forms of natural organic residues, decomposition was almost always associated with an increased content of alkyl C and a decreased content of O-alkyl C. The concomitant increase and decrease in alkyl and O-alkyl C contents respectively, suggested that the ratio of alkyl to O-alkyl carbon (A/O-A ratio) may provide a sensitive index of the extent of decomposition. Contrary to the traditional view that humic substances with an aromatic core accumulate as decomposition proceeds, changes in the aromatic region were variable and suggested a relationship with the activity of lignin-degrading fungi. The A/O-A ratio did appear to provide a sensitive index of extent of decomposition provided that its use was restricted to situations where the organic materials were derived from a common starting material. In addition, the potential for adsorption of highly decomposable materials on mineral soil surfaces and the impacts which such an adsorption may have on bioavailability required consideration when the A/O-A ratio was used to assess the extent of decomposition of organic materials found in mineral soils.","source":"Scopus","title":"Assessing the extent of decomposition of natural organic materials using solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy","volume":"35","page start":"1061","author(s) id":"7003626351;7005962676;55085284800;6603189471;6504664507;7401878066;","index keywords":"carbon-13; decomposition rate; NMR; organic matter; Fungi","document type":"Article","cited by":"443","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Chemical composition; Composts; Forest litter; Peat; Soil organic matter; Wood","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Baldock J.A., Oades J.M., Nelson P.N., Skene T.M., Golchir A., Clarke P.","doi":"10.1071/S97004"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Gero J., Mazzullo J.","x":617.88818359375,"y":2036.3548583984375,"id":"1376","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84974919616","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1984","page end":"322","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84974919616\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2f009346984791535467\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d59238d51c0fb05546ab04e579ff79c6d","source title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","abstract":"Standardized, quantified characterization of artifact shape is still problematic insofar as both intuitive shape typologies and multivariate analyses of shape attributes are limited to narrowly defined classes of artifacts exhibiting homologous morphological landmarks.

Levallois technology remains an important focus for research in Palaeolithic archaeology, yet quantitative morphological comparisons of Levallois core morphology from different regions remain rare. Here, utilizing Levallois cores from Africa, the Near East, Europe, and the Indian subcontinent, patterns of morphological variability in the shape of the Levallois flaking surface and core outline (margin) shape were examined for patterns of variability and stability across regions using 3D geometric morphometrics. The multivariate statistical shape analyses undertaken revealed a clear pattern: that is, the greatest levels of shape variability in Levallois cores is evident in the form of their outline (planform) shape. Conversely, the geometrical relationship between the margin of the Levallois cores and their topological surface morphology was relatively uniform. This pattern of variability was evident in terms of variation both across regions and between cores from the same locality. These results indicate that the outline form of such cores was a less important variable than the geometric/topological properties of the surface morphology and, in particular, the relationship between the margin of the core and those variables. These results have implications for why it has been reported that replicating such cores in modern experiments is a particularly difficult task. The specific interrelationship between the geometric properties of the core and the core margin provide further evidence that Levallois core technology would be unlikely to emerge from the context of opportunistic migrating platform reduction strategies (such as those seen in many Mode 1 industries). If, as is widely suggested, Levallois cores were deliberate products in Pleistocene contexts, these results also hint that relatively sophisticated means of social transmission (i.e. teaching) may have been required to sustain their production over time and space. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"A 3D morphometric analysis of surface geometry in Levallois cores: Patterns of stability and variability across regions and their implications","volume":"40","page start":"1508","author(s) id":"9434693200;23471109300;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; archaeology; geometry; morphology; morphometry; multivariate analysis; Paleolithic; Pleistocene; technological development; Africa; Europe; India","document type":"Article","cited by":"40","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Core variation; Geometric morphometric analysis; Levallois","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Lycett S.J., Von Cramon-Taubadel N.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.11.005"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Perttula T.K.","x":-190.53634643554688,"y":-1156.088623046875,"id":"347","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-8344272595","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2000","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Trade Caddo Vessels in Plains Village Sites in South Central Kansas, Cowley County, Kansas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Perttula T.K."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Guccione M.J.","x":308.89715576171875,"y":-129.38824462890625,"id":"1370","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-2842565537","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1984","page end":"25","source title":"Cedar Grove: An Interdisciplinary Investigation of a Late Caddo Farmstead in the Red River Valley","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Variations of the Red River Channel in Southwest Arkansas","page start":"17","cited by":"4","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00398406374501992","authors":"Guccione M.J."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Brown J.A.","x":694.685791015625,"y":-75.19730377197266,"id":"423","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84906719358","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1996","source title":"Memoirs of the Museum of Anthropology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"[No title available]","volume":"1","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Brown J.A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Palmer E.","x":371.3615417480469,"y":-1010.3921508789062,"id":"1098","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649294503","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1917","page end":"448","source title":"Publications of the Arkansas Historical Association","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Arkansas Mounds","volume":"4","page start":"390","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Palmer E."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Stewart T.D.","x":2392.389892578125,"y":698.782470703125,"id":"813","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84899756080","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1962","page end":"231","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84899756080\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fajpa.1330200207\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dc52eed1718b9db982da0dd4976cfa85d","source title":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Skeletal remains from southwestern Texas","volume":"20","page start":"213","author(s) id":"7202178743;","document type":"Article","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Stewart T.D.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.1330200207"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Anderson M.J., Ter Braak C.J.F.","x":728.0055541992188,"y":2035.0831298828125,"id":"1378","attributes":{"funding details":"University of Sydney","eid":"2-s2.0-0037319490","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"2003","page end":"113","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0037319490\u0026doi\u003d10.1080%2f00949650215733\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d162018804266957274b7849d1582021d","source title":"Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation","abstract":"Several permutation strategies are often possible for tests of individual terms in analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) designs.

Simulation results showed that permutation of residuals under a reduced model generally had greater power than the exact test or alternative approximate permutation methods (such as permutation of raw data). In several cases, restricted permutations, in particular, suffered more than other procedures, in terms of loss of power, challenging the conventional wisdom of using this approach. Our simulations also demonstrated that the choice of correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, in accordance with the guideline we provide, is essential for any permutation test, whether it be an exact test or an approximate test.

The development of water resources has always challenged human ingenuity as people have attempted to meet this basic need for survival. Nearly 4,000 years ago the king of Babylon boasted of making the desert bloom after bringing water to it. On the other side of the world, the Hohokam made a different desert bloom with the construction of intricate systems of irrigation canals between about 700 and 1450 a.d.. Long before the birth of Christ, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans all had well-developed water-supply systems that allowed these great civilizations to rise to world prominence (Owen 1980). Indeed, a classic theory regarding the very birth of civilization centered on the control of this critical resource (Wittfogel 1957). Water is at once the great enabler and the great limiting factor of human settlement. The type of water source available to support life is strongly connected to human use of the landscape. Settlement patterns and densities are related to the accessibility of a stable and potable water resource to support domestic use. As technologies for providing more stable and higher-quality water sources have emerged through time, populations and settlement distributions have grown and changed. All early settlements initially used primarily surface water; wells generally did not become commonplace until the late 1800s. With the exception of springs, the use of groundwater was unusual throughout most of the nineteenth century until pollution and disease in surface waters forced people to develop subsurface access (Kazmann 1972). The Black Prairie physiographic province of Mississippi (Figure 11.1) is developed on an outcrop of Cretaceous chalk. An investigation into the water resources of this province in Mississippi, where it is commonly referred to as the Black Prairie, shows that geology exerts a stronger control on the presence of sources of water for human use than in other areas of the state not underlain by chalk. Figure 11.2 shows the relationship between the controlling geology and surface-water features on the Black Prairie. Perennial streams do not normally exist unless their sources are outside the province, and almost all streams that do originate on the Black Prairie are ephemeral and depend on rainfall only to provide runoff. The chalk\u0027s control over the course of the Tombigbee River on the eastern edge of the Black Prairie is also evident. The development of water resources in the Black Prairie appears to fall into several discrete time categories, each associated with identi- fiable technological innovations that affected the constraints or opportunities for settlement in the region. Each progressively higher level of technology allowed greater opportunity for a less limiting arrangement of house sites and settlement distribution. The purpose of this study is to document the different levels of water-resource technology that were used to support humans as they occupied the Black Prairie from prehistoric times to the present. © 2003 by University of Alabama Press.

These techniques are hence inappropriate for any application regarding which we have a-priori biological knowledge to the contrary (e.g., genetic/morphogenetic processes common to multiple landmarks, the range of normal in anatomy atlases, the consequences of growth or function for form). But nearly every morphometric investigation is motivated by prior insights of this sort. We therefore need new tools that explicitly incorporate these elements of knowledge, should they be quantitative, to break the symmetries of the classic morphometric approaches. Some of these are already available in our literature but deserve to be known more widely: deflated (spatially adaptive) reference distributions of Procrustes coordinates, Sewall Wright’s century-old variant of factor analysis, the geometric algebra of importing explicit biomechanical formulas into Procrustes space. Other methods, not yet fully formulated, might involve parameterized models for strain in idealized forms under load, principled approaches to the separation of functional from Brownian aspects of shape variation over time, and, in general, a better understanding of how the formalism of landmarks interacts with the many other approaches to quantification of anatomy. To more powerfully organize inferences from the high-dimensional measurements that characterize so much of today’s organismal biology, tomorrow’s toolkit must rely neither on principal component analysis nor on the Procrustes distance formula, but instead on sound prior biological knowledge as expressed in formulas whose coefficients are not all the same. I describe the problems of the standard techniques, discuss several examples of the alternatives, and draw some conclusions. © 2016, The Author(s).","source":"Scopus","title":"The Inappropriate Symmetries of Multivariate Statistical Analysis in Geometric Morphometrics","volume":"43","page start":"277","author(s) id":"7004606384;","document type":"Review","cited by":"18","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Biological meaning; Biomechanics; Covariances; Deflation analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Morphometrics; Multivariate statistical analysis; Procrustes analysis","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Bookstein F.L.","doi":"10.1007/s11692-016-9382-7"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Tharp B.C.","x":-2321.41357421875,"y":-2103.42822265625,"id":"926","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0004789895","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1926","cited by":"2","source title":"Structure of Texas vegetation east of the 98th meridian","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Tharp B.C."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":339.9230651855469,"y":-1053.0736083984375,"id":"1114","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649316880","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Baldock J.A., Masiello C.A., Gélinas Y., Hedges J.I.","x":-1580.943115234375,"y":2211.396484375,"id":"288","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-9644263969","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"1-4 SPEC.

The amount of organic matter present in these systems is controlled by the relative rates of accumulation and loss. Accumulation is controlled principally by net primary productivity whilst losses are mainly a function of the biological stability of the biomolecules present. Processes of lateral transfer can also be significant to both rates of accumulation and loss in localized zones. In this paper, the processes and properties responsible for defining the biological stability of organic matter in terrestrial and marine ecosystems are examined. A conceptual model illustrating the implications that mechanisms of biological stabilisation can have on the molecular composition of natural organic matter in these ecosystems is presented. Molecular composition has typically been determined using a variety of selective degradative methodologies either individually or in combination. These methodologies often only identify 20-80% of the organic matter present with the extent of identification decreasing as the degree of biological processing increases. Solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can be used for routine assessment of the chemistry of organic materials; however, no direct measure of the molecular composition can be obtained. Previous work that examined the ability of using solid-state 13C NMR data in a simple mixing model to predict molecular composition is extended in this study. The extended mixing model is then used to characterise changes in the molecular composition of decomposing organic material in soil and marine systems. The extended mixing model accounted for the distribution of 13C NMR signal intensity of all samples examined and allowed the biomolecular and elemental composition to be estimated. Decomposition induced changes in molecular composition were very different in the terrestrial and marine systems examined, but the direction of change suggested a convergence towards the formation of similar decomposition products. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Char and charcoal occur mostly in the low temperature region of the BC continuum and as such are characterized using specific chemical and physical properties that set them apart from the more condensed forms of high temperature BC species (i.e., soot). This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using the molecular marker levoglucosan, exclusively produced from hemicellulose/cellulose combustion, to characterize and quantify char BC in the environment. A second objective was to compare the results from the molecular analysis with those from acid dichromate oxidation in terms of char BC characterization. First, we examined levoglucosan levels in a suite of BC materials derived from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion, as well as non-BC materials (coal and melanoidin). The results confirm that levoglucosan is exclusively in the char BC materials, derived from biomass combustion. However, a large variability in levoglucosan yield was observed among the different char BC materials. To understand the causes of such variability, we analyzed levoglucosan in three series of laboratory-produced char samples (n \u003d 23) made from honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), cordgrass (Spartina spartinae) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) under controlled combustion conditions (150-1050 °C, 0.5-5 h). The results show that temperature is the most influential factor affecting levoglucosan yield in char. Combustion duration, on the other hand, had no influence on yield. Notably, levoglucosan was only detectable in low temperature char samples (150-350 °C), with maximum yield obtained from samples produced at 250 °C, regardless of plant species. Large differences in levoglucosan yield were also observed across species. This taxonomic difference could not be corrected simply on the basis of hemicellulose and cellulose content, indicating that the relationship between combustion and levoglucosan formation is a complex function of many factors. Our observations also demonstrate that levoglucosan can hardly be used quantitatively for the determination of char BC in environmental samples since such samples often represent mixtures of different chars characterized by variable levoglucosan yield. Acid dichromate oxidation, as opposed to the levoglucosan method, detected mid- to high temperature char BC (≥350 °C) but not low temperature char (≤ 250 °C). Our results indicate that the overlap in the analytical windows of the two methods is limited to the upper limit of the latter. The study demonstrates that levoglucosan can serve as a good qualitative indicator for the presence of char produced under low temperature conditions in soil, sediments, and ultrafine aerosols. Although levoglucosan is not a proper quantitative proxy for char BC content in the environment, this molecular marker has a unique role in the current BC methods continuum because it traces combustion material often missed with most oxidation-based methods. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The Acheulian data set is based on previously published data with the addition here of a study of the handaxes from the site of Boxgrove, England. The MTA data set is based on four classic sites from southwest France with large handaxe collections. Both standard caliper-based morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis applied to coordinate data taken from digitized images of handaxes are used to assess shape. The result is that, contrary to expectations based on assumptions of evolving technological skill, handaxes in the MTA are as or more variable in shape than Acheulian ones. This variation is allometric in Acheulian handaxes, and is linked to resharpening from the tip down to the base, but is not related to size in the MTA samples. These results suggest that the goals and constraints of handaxe manufacture, but particularly handaxe reduction as a result of reworking during use, were quite different in the MTA and Acheulian, implying that conclusions about hominin cognition drawn from patterns in shape variability in handaxes must be understood in the context of artifact life histories. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"The handaxe reloaded: A morphometric reassessment of Acheulian and Middle Paleolithic handaxes","funding text 1":"RI and SPM wish to thank Alain Turq and Jean-Jacques Cleyet-Merle (Musée National de Préhistoire, Les-Eyzies-de-Tayac, France) for access to the MTA collections, and RI thanks Nick Ashton (British Museum) and Mark Roberts (University College London) for access to the Boxgrove collection.

The term \"evolution\" and its traditionally biological connotations, however, can provide a source of confusion, which might cause hindrance to those trying to understand the growing array of case studies that utilize these methods. Given this, a brief review of the current theoretical basis for cultural evolutionary approaches is given, which largely draws on social transmission theory. Thereafter, recent advances in the field are discussed, which have involved both methodological developments and a flourishing of empirical examples of application. Finally, future directions are considered, which, as in any developing field, will probably involve further development of both its theoretical and empirical basis, and the interaction of the two. As David Clarke identified almost half a century ago, the great strength of the archaeological record is its power to reveal meaningful patterns of artifactual variation over temporal and spatial scales, especially in statistical terms. Cultural evolutionary approaches offer a set of theoretical and methodological tools to approach, discover, and scientifically analyze this potential wealth of information about past societies. Future developments will necessarily follow, but the place of this related body of theory and techniques within archaeology is now firmly established. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Cultural evolutionary approaches to artifact variation over time and space: Basis, progress, and prospects","volume":"56","page start":"21","author(s) id":"9434693200;","index keywords":"archaeology; artifact; culture; evolutionary theory; learning; social theory","document type":"Article","cited by":"43","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Cultural evolution; Evolutionary archaeology; Social learning; Social transmission","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Lycett S.J.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2015.01.004"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Caruana M.V., Carvalho S., Braun D.R., Presnyakova D., Haslam M., Archer W., Bobe R., Harris J.W.K.","x":321.9601135253906,"y":1939.319580078125,"id":"218","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84912084301","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2014","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84912084301\u0026doi\u003d10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0113856\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d89c3e267a60b11ac619866b9d99cffb2","access type":"Open Access","source title":"PLoS ONE","abstract":"Percussive technology continues to play an increasingly important role in understanding the evolution of tool use. Comparing the archaeological record with extractive foraging behaviors in nonhuman primates has focused on percussive implements as a key to investigating the origins of lithic technology. Despite this, archaeological approaches towards percussive tools have been obscured by a lack of standardized methodologies. Central to this issue have been the use of qualitative, non-diagnostic techniques to identify percussive tools from archaeological contexts. Here we describe a new morphometric method for distinguishing anthropogenically-generated damage patterns on percussive tools from naturally damaged river cobbles. We employ a geomatic approach through the use of three-dimensional scanning and geographical information systems software to statistically quantify the identification process in percussive technology research. This will strengthen current technological analyses of percussive tools in archaeological frameworks and open new avenues for translating behavioral inferences of early hominins from percussive damage patterns. © 2014 Caruana et al.","source":"Scopus","title":"Quantifying traces of tool use: A novel morphometric analysis of damage patterns on percussive tools","volume":"9","author(s) id":"56428943400;23977799600;23972180300;56429690500;8779231000;35085743300;6603731660;55740177800;","index keywords":"Article; artifact; computer program; controlled study; geographic information system; Hot Spot analysis; morphometrics; percussive technology; quantitative analysis; rank sum test; statistical analysis; three dimensional imaging; animal; animal behavior; fossil; physiology; primate; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Fossils; Primates","document type":"Article","cited by":"22","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e113856","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Caruana M.V., Carvalho S., Braun D.R., Presnyakova D., Haslam M., Archer W., Bobe R., Harris J.W.K.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0113856"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bruseth J.E., Pierson W.T., Johnson R.M.","x":86.07445526123047,"y":274.85845947265625,"id":"1007","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-61949099314","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2008","page end":"148","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-61949099314\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d4e6732e2e896173fb434ca45772fed96","source title":"Journal of Field Archaeology","abstract":"This paper describes the benefits of collecting total field magnetic data at archaeological sites with a mobile cart holding two cesium magnetometer sensors and a separate stationary base station magnetometer to correct for global-scale magnetic fluctuations.

The idea has its roots in the intensely productive decade (archaeologically) of the 1930s and is fundamentally tied to yet another venerable concept-Mississippian culture. The last comprehensive study of the melding of these two concepts into the term Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) is more than two decades old, yet our understanding of the objects, themes, and artistic styles associated with the SECC have changed a great deal. New primary data have come to light that bear directly on the complex, requiring a thorough reanalysis of both concepts and dating. Recent publications have ignited many debates about the dating and the nature of the SECC. This work presents new data and new ideas on the temporal and social contexts, artistic styles, and symbolic themes included in the complex. It also demonstrates that engraved shell gorgets, along with other SECC materials, were produced before A.D. 1400. Copyright © 2007 The University of Alabama Press.

Related to this problem is the absence of a robust statistical technique for comparing variation between different kinds of assemblages. This paper addresses these issues. The Weber fraction for line-length estimation describes the minimum difference that humans can perceive through unaided visual inspection. This value is used to derive a constant for the coefficient of variation (CV \u003d 1.7 percent) that represents the highest degree of standardization attainable through manual human production of artifacts. Random data are used to define a second constant for the coefficient of variation that represents variation expected when production is random (CV \u003d 57.7 percent). These two constants can be used to assess the degree of standardization in artifact assemblages regardless of kind. Our analysis further demonstrates that CV is an excellent measure of standardization and provides a robust statistical technique for comparing standardization in samples of artifacts.

Often regarded as complementary techniques, solid state 13C NMR and Py-GC/MS are widely used for the characterisation of organic matter. Recently, a molecular mixing model (MMM) was proposed to predict the distribution of C in biochemical components (carbohydrate, protein, lignin, lipid, char) from the 13C NMR spectral distribution, thereby allowing a quantitative comparison with Py-GC/MS product abundances. We discuss the application of this model to a peat core, by comparing NMR-MMM results with Py-GC/MS data. The core represents ∼5000 yr accumulation and ranges from fibric (at the surface) to hemic (bottom). The amounts of carbohydrates and lipids predicted by the MMM and calculated from the quantified Py-GC/MS chromatograms are in close agreement. However, the well known low capability of the conventional Py-GC/MS method to provide structural information on proteins from bulk soils, the poor GC amenability of polar compounds and many other possible sources of inaccuracy in Py-GC/MS and NMR-MMM caused discrepancies with predictions made with the MMM. Also, the MMM failed to give good prediction of the C/N ratio of the peat material. Although the NMR-MMM approach does not account for molecular transitions during decomposition, this oversimplification proved to be acceptable. The MMM seems to be a useful tool for the interpretation of NMR spectral distributions in peat material. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose an approach to investigate the role of development for morphological asymmetry by means of morphometric methods. Our approach combines geometric morphometrics with the two-way ANOVA customary for conventional analyses of fluctuating asymmetry and can discover localized features of shape variation by examining the patterns of covariance among landmarks This approach extends the notion of form used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry from collections of distances between morphological landmarks to an explicitly geometric concept of shape characterized by the configuration of landmarks. We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse files (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females. The morphological landmarks differed markedly in their degree of variability, but multivariate patterns of landmark covariation identified by principal component analysis were generally similar between fluctuating asymmetry (within-individual variability) and variation among individuals.

Charcoal is an important source of palaeoenvironmental data, and of great interest as a potential carbon sink, due to its high apparent environmental stability. However, at least some forms of charcoal are clearly susceptible to environmental alteration and degradation over relatively short timescales. Although these processes have importance for the role of charcoal in global biogeochemistry, they remain poorly understood. Here we present results of an investigation into the susceptibility of a range of charcoal samples to oxidative degradation in acidified potassium dichromate. The study examines both freshly-produced charcoal, and charcoal exposed to environmental conditions for up to 50,000. years. We compare the proportion of carbon present in different forms between the samples, specifically with respect to the relative chemical resistance of these forms. This was undertaken in order to improve understanding of the post-depositional diagenetic changes affecting charcoal within environmental deposits. A wide range in chemical compositions are apparent both within and between the sample groups. In freshly-produced charcoal, material produced at 300 °C contains carbon with more labile forms than charcoal produced at 400 °C, signifying a key chemical change over the 300-400 °C temperature range. Charcoal exposed to environmental depositional conditions is frequently composed of a highly carboxylated aromatic structure and contains a range of carbon fractions of varying oxidative resistance. These findings suggest that a significant number of the environmental charcoals have undergone post-depositional diagenetic alteration. Further, the data highlight the potential for the use of controlled progressive oxidative degradation as a method to characterize chemical differences between individual charcoal samples. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Variability in oxidative degradation of charcoal: Influence of production conditions and environmental exposure","funding text 1":"This research was funded by NERC standard Grant NE/F017456/1 and NERC standard Grant NE/C004531/1.

At Moundville, a major Mississippian center in Alabama, midden and feature-fill deposits attributed to elite behavior have been excavated in several areas. Deposits on Mounds Q and G dating to the Moundville II and 111 phases (ca. A.D. 1260-1450) are similar in that they incorporate abundant domestic debris associated with structures on mound summits. On both mounds, food remains show evidence of provisioning and the consumption of small-scale meats rather than feasting. However, the two contexts differ in the occurrence of evidence for skilled era fling and the display of human skeletal remains. At Mound Q, skilled crafling is abundantly attested, employing local and nonlocal raw materials. Display goods were routinely handled, and pigment processing and use were important. Burials were rarely made, but fragmentary human bone is scattered throughout, emphasizing portions of the skeleton consistent with display. In contrast, elite contexts on Mound G show little or no evidence ofcrafling, pigment use, and bone handling.

The pattern of enhancement of certain elements, including P, Pb, Ca, Zn, and Cu, has been shown by numerous studies to correlate closely with the archaeological and historical record. Interpretation of these soil signatures, however, has generally been more problematic. One approach to the problem has been the use of ethnographic or \"known\" sites to guide interpretation, but how confidently can results from one site be extrapolated to another? This study of abandoned farms tests the site specificity of soil multi-element signatures of past space use through the use of discriminant models. Data analysis suggests that one to one comparisons of similar sites are much less accurate (38% accuracy) than comparisons based on a wider range of sites (59.3% accuracy), even when the latter have contrasting geology. The results highlight the importance of individual anthropogenic practices during occupation and abandonment in the development of diagnostic soil geochemical signatures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For Clovis peoples, the earliest well-documented North Americans, resharpening is believed to have been particularly important because foraging territories were unknown or poorly known. Gardner (1983, Archaeol East N Amer 11, 49-64) proposed a spatial model of Clovis point resharpening wherein the effects of resharpening increase with distance from stone outcrop. Here we report a study that quantitatively assesses Gardner\u0027s model using a large sample of Clovis points from three high-quality chert sources in the Midwest. To investigate the predictions of the model, we used least-cost pathway distances from outcrop locations to each Clovis point and three measures of point resharpening. Our expectations, derived from the model, are that as distance from outcrop increases, points should show evidence of increased resharpening and therefore be smaller in size; should deviate from the classic shape; and should exhibit greater outer-to-inner flake-scar ratios. Our results indicate that there is no spatial patterning of these three measures of point resharpening and therefore do not support Gardner\u0027s model. Further analyses suggest that resharpening was not a significant source of Clovis-point variation at the population level and that Clovis points in the Midwest may not have served as the long-life tools as has been generally assumed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Size, shape, scars, and spatial patterning: A quantitative assessment of late Pleistocene (Clovis) point resharpening","funding text 1":"This research would not have been possible without Kenneth Tankersley\u0027s (1989) dissertation work in creating the Indiana–Kentucky–Ohio fluted-point database and in making the database available on the Paleoindian Database of the Americas ( http://pidba.utk.edu/main.htm ).

Resultant elemental signatures allow the identification of site features and organization in the absence of large-scale excavation. All the archeological sites showed similar and distinct chemical signatures regardless of the several thousand year date range of the sites or the length of time a site was occupied. However, intensity of occupation does appear to affect concentrations of elements. Site features such as houses, house berms, house floors and middens had distinct anthropogenic signatures and could be distinguished from one another. This approach may be used to identify sites that do not have distinct surface features and to target areas for excavation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Reconstructing site organization in the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska using multi-element chemical analysis of soils","funding text 1":"This research was financially supported by National Science Foundation grants NSF OPP 0326584 , NSF BE/CNH 0508101 and NSF 0817711.

Ritchie’s A Typology and Nomenclature of New York State Projectile Points remains an influential resource for archaeologists working in the northeastern US.

In this chapter, we propose that alternative approaches afforded by computer vision and morphometrics can shed light on this and other problems of traditional stone tool typology. With the advent of computer vision, we can now examine the entire morphological continuum of projectile points through statistical shape analysis. Following automated image capture, three analytical methods were evaluated using silhouette, outline, and landmark data. Biased free capture methods to record the form of an individual projectile point, together with using invariant shape descriptors to quantify the data, may result in more objective analysis than was possible in the past. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","source":"Scopus","title":"Towards automating artifact analysis: A study showing potential applications of computer vision and morphometrics to artifact typology","volume":"124","page start":"289","author(s) id":"57203417618;57203408122;","document type":"Book Chapter","cited by":"7","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Lenardi M.J., Merwin D.E.","doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-95853-6_13"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":-38.221275329589844,"y":-196.20590209960938,"id":"1044","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85036720211","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1920","source title":"Certain Caddo Sites in Arkansas.

Construction entailed significant earth-moving and labor effort in addition to the erection of mounds flanking the plaza. At Raffman plaza, building is dated ca. A.D. 700-1000. Like the mounds at the site, the arrangement, shape, and dimensions of the plaza changed through time. The final plan of the plaza was the result of a rapid major reconfiguration of the spatial layout of the site at approximately A.D. 1000. The effort expended on planning and construction of the plaza at Raffman and similar features at contemporary and later sites in the southeastern United States indicates that plazas are not just empty spaces that developed because architecture enclosed an open area; they must be understood as one of the central design elements of community planning and intrasite spatial organization. Further research should be devoted to exploring how southeastern mound-and-plaza groups were constructed with specific efforts devoted to comprehending how plazas were laid out and built.Las investigaciones en el sitio Raffman (16MA20), un centro de múltiples montícules en el valle bajo del Mississippi de Luisiana nororiental, demuestran que la plaza se construyó y extendió con un propósito determinado en su extreme norte. La construcción supuso un significativo desplazamiento de tierra y esfuerzo laboral, además del levantamiento de los montículos al lado de la plaza. La construcción de la plaza de Raffman data de los años 700-1000 d.C.Al igual que los montículos del sitio, la disposición, la forma y las dimensiones de la plaza fueron cambiando con el paso del tiempo. El plano final de la plaza fue el resultado de una rápida e importante reconfiguración de la distribución espacial del sitio en el año 1000 d.C., aproximadamente. El esfuerzo invertido en el diseño y la construcción de la plaza de Raffman, y características similares a las de otros sitios contemporáneos y posteriores en el sudeste de los Estados Unidos indican que las plazas no fueron sólo espacios vacios que surgieron al construirse alrededor de áreas abiertas. Las plazas deben ser entendidas, en cambio, como uno de los elementos de diseńo centrales en la planificación de la comunidad y en la organización espacial dentro de los sitios (inuasite). Las investigaciones futuras deben dedicarse a explorar cómo los grupos de plazas y montículos del sudeste se construyeron con propósitos específicos, y orientados a entender cómo se trazaron y construyeron las plazas.

The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies. © 2017","source":"Scopus","title":"Archaeology, biology, and borrowing: A critical examination of Geometric Morphometrics in Archaeology","funding text 1":"The authors would like to thank Thilo Rehren, Christian Hoggard, and Sarah Stark for the assistance with the publication of this article.

In spite of intervening biases, numbers of radiocarbon dates should reflect the patterns of occupation across time. Using the date record of preceramic Perú, I illustrate very different radiocarbon trends for highland and coastal zones. These suggest exponential growth, equilibrium, and altitude shift for the occupations of coastal, puna, and highland valley regions. Biases caused by variation in temporal and geographic investigation, and the effects of sea-level rise are considered, but I argue that general occupational patterns overshadow distortions of the date record.

Carbon-13 NMR spectra were acquired using both cross-polarisation (CP) and direct polarisation (DP) techniques. Overall, the corresponding CP and DP spectra were similar, although aromaticity was slightly higher and observability much higher when DP was used. The relative size and purity of the aromatic ring structures (i.e. aromatic condensation) were also gauged using the ring current technique. Both aromaticity and aromatic condensation increased with increasing production temperature, regardless of the feedstock source. However, there were clear differences in these two measures for biochars produced at the same temperature but from different feedstocks. Based on a relationship previously established in a long-term incubation study between aromatic condensation and the mean residence time (MRT) of biochar, the MRT of the biochars was estimated to range from \u0026lt;260 years to \u0026gt;1400 years. This study demonstrates how the combination of feedstock composition and production temperature influences the composition of aromatic domains in biochars, which in turn is likely to be related to their recalcitrance and ultimately their carbon sequestration value. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"The influence of feedstock and production temperature on biochar carbon chemistry: A solid-state 13C NMR study","funding text 1":"This project was supported by funding from the Australian Government under its Climate Change Research Program and by the Grains Research and Development Corporation .","volume":"60","page start":"121","author(s) id":"35099201000;6701718524;7003553907;7202265439;","index keywords":"Aromatic ring structure; Bio chars; Carbon sequestration; Increasing production; Long-term incubation; Mean residence time; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Temperature influence; Aromatic compounds; Carbon; Condensation; Feedstocks; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Polarization; Pyrolysis; Aromatization; biofuel; carbon sequestration; charcoal; condensation; nuclear magnetic resonance; polarization; purification; temperature effect","document type":"Article","cited by":"83","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Aromatic condensation; Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Mean residence time; Pyrolysis; Solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"McBeath A.V., Smernik R.J., Krull E.S., Lehmann J.","doi":"10.1016/j.biombioe.2013.11.002"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Powell M.L.","x":-2055.42431640625,"y":-146.81504821777344,"id":"657","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0000251450","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1985","page end":"338","source title":"The Analysis of Prehistoric Diets","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The analysis of dental wear and caries for dietary reconstruction","page start":"307","cited by":"118","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Powell M.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Cavalli-Sforza L.L., Menozzi P., Piazza A.","x":2567.055908203125,"y":921.1372680664062,"id":"748","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003675970","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1994","cited by":"3315","source title":"The History and Geography of Human Genes","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Cavalli-Sforza L.L., Menozzi P., Piazza A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":533.47607421875,"y":220.5691680908203,"id":"1332","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039219134","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"0","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.008964143426294821","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Holliday V.T., Meltzer D.J.","x":2129.98583984375,"y":848.4744873046875,"id":"772","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0000899489","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1996","page end":"771","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0000899489\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f282016\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003daf5772008115e1209d4b40521956ebb0","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"In 1953 human remains and a new type of Paleoindian artifact were discovered eroding from a \"blowout\" in a small dune field along Monahans Draw, near Midland, Texas, on the Southern High Plains. The projectile points became the type \"Midland\" collection. Stratigraphy, radiometric dating, paleontology, and geochemistry suggested that the artifacts and bones dated to at least 10,000 B.P. and that the human remains were possibly as old as 20,000 B.P. The researchers believed that the human bones were from below a red sand that in turn was below a Folsom occupation. The dating of the human remains has long been problematic, however, and recent attempts to apply U-series dating further confuse the story. Geoarchaeological investigations were carried out at the site from 1989 to 1992 to reevahtate the geochronology, with particular reference to the age of the skeletal material. We reach several conclusions: (1) there are two Red Sands; (2) the human remains are from below the upper Red Sand, but the Folsom material is from above the lower Red Sand and, therefore, the Red Sand stratigraphy is not relevant to the age of the human remains; (3) the human remains were associated with the valley-margin facies of a lacustrine carbonate that is well dated in the region and rarely is \u003e 10,000 B.P.; and (4) all numerical dating methods applied at the site produced unreliable results. We find no compelling evidence that the human remains from the Midland site are older than Folsom age; they may be contemporary with or younger than the Folsom occupation.

This study focuses on element-based provenance studies of Mississippian-period pottery, which are complicated by the fact that this pottery generally was tempered with crushed shell in different amounts and of unknown species composition. Experiments conducted at the Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) have documented elemental dilution and enhancement effects of adding shell temper to clay. Mathematical corrections previously have been employed to correct for shell-temper effects. Results of physical, chemical, and mathematical approaches to eliminating the effects of shell tempering indicate that mathematical methods, based on a firm knowledge of shell composition, provide the most efficient correction.

Whereas standard multivariate statistics procedures are fine for \"static\" variation - testing for location differences of groups in multivariate data spaces - they are limited for \"dynamic\" variation - testing specific differences in the ways groups change locations associated with changes in state along ecological, developmental or evolutionary gradients. In this paper, we show that continuous phenotypic change can be described by trajectories in multivariate data spaces. We describe the geometric attributes of phenotypic change trajectories (size, direction, and shape), specifically for GM data. We illustrate, with examples, how differences in such attributes can function as test statistics for comparative analyses in order to understand the mechanisms that produce dynamic differences in shape change. We demonstrate that analysis of such attributes - called phenotypic trajectory analysis (PTA) - is a general analysis that can be applied to various types of research questions concerned with measuring dynamic variation. Finally, we posit some challenges for the future for this novel analytical method. © 2013 Associazione Teriologica Italiana.","source":"Scopus","title":"Phenotypic trajectory analysis: Comparison of

This is an especially useful approach for high-dimensional (multivariate) data. Here, we present an r package that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for applying RRPP to linear models. Important available features include choices for OLS or GLS coefficient estimation, data or dissimilarity matrix analysis capability, choice among types I, II, or III sums of squares and cross-products, various effect size estimation methods, and an ability to perform mixed-model ANOVA. The lm.rrpp function is similar to the lm function in many regards, but provides coefficient and ANOVA statistics estimates over many random permutations. The S3 generic functions commonly used with lm also work with lm.rrpp. Additionally, a pairwise function provides statistical tests for comparisons of least-squares means or slopes, among designated groups. Users have many options for varying random permutations. Compared to similar available packages and functions, RRPP is extremely fast and yields comprehensive results for downstream analyses and graphics, following model fits with lm.rrpp. The RRPP package facilitates analysis of both univariate and multivariate response data, even when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. © 2018 The Authors.

Since that time the field of geometric morphometrics has matured into a rich and cohesive discipline for the study of shape variation and covariation. The development of the field is identified with the Procrustes paradigm, a methodological approach to shape analysis arising from the intersection of the statistical shape theory and analytical procedures for obtaining shape variables from landmark data. In this review we describe the Procrustes paradigm and the current methodological toolkit of geometric morphometrics. We highlight some of the theoretical advances that have occurred over the past ten years since our prior review (Adams et al., 2004), what types of anatomical structures are amenable to these approaches, and how they extend the reach of geometric morphometrics to more specialized applications for addressing particular biological hypotheses.

The present work seeks to fill this gap, using as a case study a corpus of 154 complete ceramic vessels from the Bibracte oppidum (France), the capital of the Celtic tribe Aedui from the Second Iron Age. Two outline-based approaches were selected: the Elliptic Fourier Analysis and the Discrete Cosine Transform. They were combined with numerous methods of standardisation/normalisation. Although standardisations may use either perimeter or surface, the resulting morphospaces remain comparable, and, interestingly, are also comparable with the morphospace built from traditional typology. Geometric morphometrics also presentthe advantage of being easily implemented and automated for large sets of artefacts. The method is reproducible and provides quantitative estimates, such as mean shape, and shape diversity of ceramic assemblages, allowing objective inferences to be statistically tested. The approach can easily be generalised and adopted for other kinds of artefacts, to study the level of production standardisation and the evolution of shape over space and time, and to provide information about material and cultural exchanges. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Morphometrics of Second Iron Age ceramics - strengths, weaknesses, and comparison with traditional typology","funding text 1":"We are grateful to the Centre Archéologique Européen de Bibracte, and more particularly its director, Vincent Guichard, for constant support.

In Palaeolithic archaeology\u0027s sister discipline of palaeoanthropology, detailed quantitative morphometric, geometric morphometric, and even 3D geometric morphometric analyses are now seen almost as routine. This period of relative methodological stasis may have been influenced by the lack of homologous landmarks on many lithic tools (essential for any comparative analysis), especially core-based technologies of the Lower Palaeolithic. Archaeological field conditions may also prohibit the use of expensive and delicate precision instruments in certain cases. Here we present a crossbeam co-ordinate caliper that - crucially - both geometrically locates and measures distances between morphologically homologous landmarks upon lithic nuclei via a single protocol. Intra- and inter-observer error tests provide evidence that error levels associated with the instrument fall within acceptable ranges. In addition, we present empirical examples of application in the form of a multivariate analysis of 55 discrete morphometric variables, and a 3D geometric morphometric analysis of co-ordinate landmark configurations derived from Pleistocene lithic nuclei (i.e. \u0027cores\u0027 sensu lato). We also introduce to lithic studies some techniques for the study of shape variation that have previously been used with success in biological morphometric analyses. We conclude that use of an instrument such as the crossbeam co-ordinate caliper may provide a useful adjunct to traditional techniques of lithic analysis, particularly in developing a quantitative morphometric approach. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The lignin oxidation products (LOPs), quantified using the alkaline cupric oxide (CuO) oxidation method, were used to study the impact of combustion on lignins and their commonly used parameters. Our results show that combustion can greatly decrease the yield of the eight major lignin phenols (vanillyl, syringyl and cinnamyl phenols) with no lignin phenols detected in any synthetic char produced at ≥ 400 °C. With increasing combustion temperature, the value of the syringyl/vanillyl phenols ratio (S/V) of angiosperm char initially increased but then declined dramatically when the temperature reached 200-250 °C. The pattern of change may relate to the thermal alteration of the plant cell ultrastructure. The cinnamyl/vanillyl phenols ratio value (C/V) of a non-woody plant, cordgrass, also showed a similar two-stage change with increasing combustion temperature. Combustion duration also caused a similar effect on the yield and signatures of lignin phenols, showing that the combustion severity (temperature and/or duration) has great influence on LOP yield and signature. The acid/aldehyde ratio of vanillyl phenols [(Ad/Al)v] and syringyl phenols [(Ad/Al)s] increased with increasing combustion temperature and duration and reached a maximum value at 300-350 °C, regardless of plant species. The highly elevated acid/aldehyde ratio value reached in some cases exceeded the reported values of humic and fulvic acids extracted from soils and sediments. Furthermore, the ratio of 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid to vanillyl phenols (3,5Bd/V), a soil humification indicator, increased significantly during combustion at 250-350 °C in char samples from all the plant species. Our results imply that changes in LOP signatures in chars can serve as potential indicators of their formation temperature. Simulations using a two end member mixing model showed that different char samples, with different degrees of lignin alteration, could have a substantial effect on the biomarker signatures of soil organic matter (SOM). The shifts in lignin signatures in SOM vary widely, depending on the SOM characteristics (e.g. soil litter vs. mineral soil) and the proportion of char in the mixture. Overall, the input of high temperature char tends to dilute the lignin signal in SOM and may lead to underestimation of vascular plant OM input to environmental matrices. Our observations demonstrate that, in addition to photochemical degradation, thermal alteration is an important abiotic lignin degradation process. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using OxCal\u0027s MCMC sampling routine, I introduce and demonstrate a simple and easily implemented method of estimating front speeds that takes due account of the uncertainty in the archaeological data (in both dates and distances), and argue that this method is more appropriate than those most often used in front speed estimation at present. I also propose a simple and easily implemented method of estimating event densities as a demographic proxy, as an alternative to summed calibrated probability distributions. I argue that this alternative is a significantly better technique, and show that its use also enables us to identify individual archaeological dates that are exerting particularly strong influence on the results, so that we can efficiently allocate our attention when assessing the possible effects of exogenous sampling uncertainty. To illustrate these methods I re-analyse two published datasets relating to the early Paleoindian colonization of North America. My results with the new technique indicate that even with a very noisy dataset, there was clear evidence in the framework of the INTCAL04 calibration curve for a drastic reduction in archaeological event densities following the Younger Dryas onset, followed by a prolonged period of reduced human activity, and a possible renewed phase of rapid growth after the Younger Dryas termination and onset of the Holocene. However, the revised estimate of the Younger Dryas marine reservoir offset in the INTCAL09 calibration curve for ~12,550-12,900 cal BP changes the picture significantly, by flattening the peak in Clovis-age events and pushing it forward in time into the early Younger Dryas itself. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Radiocarbon dates as data: Quantitative strategies for estimating colonization front speeds and event densities","volume":"37","page start":"2017","author(s) id":"35265312900;","index keywords":"archaeology; colonization; demographic history; Holocene; human activity; population density; population growth; prehistoric; radiocarbon dating; Younger Dryas","document type":"Article","cited by":"75","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"14C; Clovis culture; Fisher-KPP; OxCal; Radiocarbon; Traveling waves; Younger Dryas","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Steele J.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2010.03.007"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Thulman D.K.","x":569.5736694335938,"y":2193.847900390625,"id":"1374","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84857117297","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"2012","page end":"1607","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84857117297\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2012.01.004\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dab61ca96cff8608d83742201f68cad84","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Traditional artifact typologies are typically poorly defined.

In the lower Mississippi Valley, however, there is an abrupt gap in the archaeological sequence at this time and pronounced differences between Late Archaic and Early Woodland archaeological remains. Elsewhere in the basin, this transition is marked by an occupation hiatus or decline and is accompanied by significant changes in settlement and material culture organization. In most parts of the floodplain of the Mississippi River and its tributaries there are few sites dating to this interval suggesting the river bottom was abandoned for several hundred years as a location for sustained habitation. High-resolution climate data demonstrates an episode of rapid global climate change involving significant alterations in temperature and precipitation in the period ca. 3000-2600 calB.P. The proximate cause of this global climate occurrence is change in galactic cosmic ray intensity and solar irradiation possibly amplified by variations in the earth\u0027s geomagnetic field. Global climate changes led to greatly increased flood frequencies and magnitudes in the Mississippi River watershed during the shift from Late Archaic to Early Woodland. In northeast Louisiana, increased flooding led to major fluvial reorganization that caused settlement abandonment and is associated with the demise of Poverty Point culture. Climate change and associated flooding is implicated as one cause of major cultural reorganization at the end of the Archaic throughout much of eastern North America.

The OR of the terrestrial biosphere must be well characterized to accurately estimate the terrestrial CO2 sink using atmospheric measurements of changing O2 and CO2 levels. To estimate the OR of the terrestrial biosphere, measurements are needed of changes in the OR of aboveground and belowground carbon pools associated with decadal timescale disturbances (e.g., land use change and fire). The OR of aboveground pools can be measured using conventional approaches including elemental analysis. However, measuring the OR of soil carbon pools is technically challenging, and few soil OR data are available. In this paper we test three solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for measuring soil OR, all based on measurements of the closely related parameter, organic carbon oxidation state (Cox). Two of the three techniques make use of a molecular mixing model which converts NMR spectra into concentrations of a standard suite of biological molecules of known C ox. The third technique assigns Cox values to each peak in the NMR spectrum. We assess error associated with each technique using pure chemical compounds and plant biomass standards whose Cox and OR values can be directly measured by elemental analyses. The most accurate technique, direct polarization solid-state 13C NMR with the molecular mixing model, agrees with elemental analyses to ±0.036 Cox units (±0.009 OR units). Using this technique, we show a large natural variability in soil Cox and OR values. Soil Cox values have a mean of -0.26 and a range from -0.45 to 0.30, corresponding to OR values of 1.08 ± 0.06 and a range from 0.96 to 1.22. We also estimate the OR of the carbon flux from a boreal forest fire. Analysis of soils from nearby intact soil profiles imply that soil carbon losses associated with the fire had an OR of 1.091 (±0.003). Fire appears to be a major factor driving the soil C pool to higher oxidation states and lower OR values. Episodic fluxes caused by disturbances like fire may have substantially different ORs from ecosystem respiration fluxes and therefore should be better quantified to reduce uncertainties associated with our understanding of the global atmospheric carbon budget.

Recently, two comparative methods were proposed to circumvent this difficulty. One obtains phylogenetic independent contrasts for all variables, and statistically evaluates the linear model by permuting the phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs) of the response data. The other uses a distance-based approach to obtain coefficients for generalized least squares models (D-PGLS), and subsequently permutes the original data to evaluate the model effects. Here, we show that permuting PICs is not equivalent to permuting the data prior to the analyses as in D-PGLS. We further explain why PICs are not the correct exchangeable units under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate that this misspecification of permutable units leads to inflated type I error rates of statistical tests. We then show that simply shuffling the original data and recalculating the independent contrasts with each iteration yields significance levels that correspond to those found using D-PGLS. Thus, while summary statistics from methods based on PICs and PGLS are the same, permuting PICs can lead to strikingly different inferential outcomes with respect to statistical and biological inferences. © 2015 The Author(s).","source":"Scopus","title":"Permutation tests for phylogenetic comparative analyses of high-dimensional shape data: What you shuffle matters","volume":"69","page start":"823","author(s) id":"7404054540;57074630100;","index keywords":"comparative study; morphometry; phenotype; phylogenetics; statistical analysis; anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; body size; comparative study; genetics; head; phylogeny; regression analysis; statistical model; Urodela; Animals; Body Size; Head; Least-Squares Analysis; Linear Models; Models, Genetic; Phylogeny; Urodela","document type":"Article","cited by":"42","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Geometric morphometrics; Phylogenetic comparative method; Phylogenetic generalized least squares; Phylogenetic independent contrasts","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Adams D.C., Collyer M.L.","doi":"10.1111/evo.12596"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bayliss A., Bronk Ramsey C.","x":-774.6470336914062,"y":395.85589599609375,"id":"608","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33947585233","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2004","page end":"41","source title":"Tools for Constructing Chronologies: Tools for Crossing Disciplinary Boundaries","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Pragmatic Bayesians: A decade integrating radiocarbon dates into chronological models","page start":"25","cited by":"67","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Bayliss A., Bronk Ramsey C."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Beck M.E.","x":-1716.2178955078125,"y":1953.8299560546875,"id":"332","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-34247111530","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"4","year":"2007","page end":"475","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-34247111530\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fgea.20161\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d83b6f1d714c942fe9b2878ca0773caed","source title":"Geoarchaeology","abstract":"Middens are surprisingly fluid entities in occupied communities, as shown by ethnoarchaeological research in Dalupa, Kalinga Province, northern Luzon, the Philippines.

Most surface samples from habitation areas cluster with midden samples, although samples from the lower parts of theses profiles resemble samples from natural contexts around Dalupa. One explanation is a changing spatial distribution of active middens due to changes in house placement and occupation in Dalupa\u0027s history. Some habitation areas that chemically resemble middens may once have held middens, as suggested by the periodic changes in midden location from the cleaning and management of extramural space.

The results identify several protocols, recommended as best-practice when using summed probability plots: 1) a minimum sample size of 500 radiocarbon dates should be used, and the sample size and the mean of the standard deviations of the radiocarbon dates (Δ T) in the sample should both be reported; 2) a moving average trendline of 500-800 years should be used to offset the effects of the calibration process; and 3) Surovell et al. \" Correcting temporal frequency distributions for taphonomic bias\" [.

Correction of time-series data using theoretical taphonomic correction curves is useful as a heuristic tool but can obscure real trends if applied routinely.

Taphonomic bias refers to the tendency for younger things to be over-represented relative to older things in the archaeological record due to the operation of destructive processes like erosion and weathering. Using a database of radiocarbon dated volcanic deposits from Bryson, R.U., Bryson, R.A., Ruter, A. [2006. A calibrated radiocarbon database of late Quaternary volcanic eruptions. Earth Discussions 1, 123-124.], we develop an empirical model of taphonomic bias. In contrast to our prior study in which we modeled taphonomic bias as an exponential function wherein the likelihood of site loss remains constant through time, we argue that the probability of site destruction actually decreases with site age. We further demonstrate how this model can be used to correct temporal frequency distributions and extract demographic histories.

Therefore, calcium oxalate crystals are the most likely source of previously documented dental microwear and wear in the lower Pecos region.","source":"Scopus","title":"Human dental microwear caused by calcium oxalate phytoliths in prehistoric diet of the lower Pecos region, Texas","volume":"107","page start":"297","author(s) id":"8618477900;7006455158;","index keywords":"calcium oxalate; silicon dioxide; anthropology; article; chemical structure; dentition; diet; hardness; human; human tissue; paleopathology; quantitative diagnosis; tooth injury; united states; Calcium Oxalate; Diet; History, Ancient; Humans; Paleodontology; Texas; Tooth Erosion","document type":"Article","cited by":"47","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Dental wear; Phytolith; Texas","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Danielson D.R., Reinhard K.J.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(199811)107:3\u003c297::AID-AJPA6\u003e3.0.CO;2-M"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Davis E.M., Gipson J.R.","x":422.7747802734375,"y":-75.32453918457031,"id":"1421","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84900897065","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1960","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Dalton Site: A Late Caddoan Mound Site in the Ferrell\u0027s Bridge Reservoir Area, Northeastern Texas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00398406374501992","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Davis E.M., Gipson J.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Wood W.R.","x":311.4501953125,"y":-1052.28759765625,"id":"1101","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84857569230","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1963","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Denham Mound: A Mid-Ouachita Focus Temple Mound in Hot Spring County.","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Wood W.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Harmon A.M., Rose J.C.","x":-2307.849609375,"y":-243.12548828125,"id":"691","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-1542500061","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1989","page end":"354","source title":"Archeology and Bioarcheology of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Trans-Mississippi South in Arkansas and Louisiana","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Bioarcheology of the Louisiana and Arkansas Study Area","page start":"323","cited by":"12","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Harmon A.M., Rose J.C."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":380.76629638671875,"y":-2500.568359375,"id":"583","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039605940","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1910","page end":"96","source title":"Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London, 2nd Ser.","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Report of the red hills exploration committee, 1908-9","volume":"23","page start":"66","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Burton L.P.","x":533.10302734375,"y":-545.5072021484375,"id":"1263","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-69549148795","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1971","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Prehistory of Delaware County, Oklahoma: Cultural Continuity and Change on the Western Ozark Periphery","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Burton L.P."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Lankford G.E.","x":-342.9012145996094,"y":-666.7677612304688,"id":"842","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84904237759","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2007","page end":"38","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84904237759\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dbce031dc12ef64d2b489b248ecf64d92","source title":"Ancient Objects and Sacred Realms: Interpretations of Mississippian Iconography","abstract":"Similar prehistoric iconographic images on shell, copper, and ceramics have been found across a wide geographic area in the Eastern Woodlands and the Plains. Even if the area is reduced to its presumed major centers for diffusion, such as Spiro, Moundville, and Etowah/Tennessee Valley, it still seems certain that the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex was international in nature, encompassing groups speaking different languages and manifesting somewhat different cultural traditions. The sharing of a visual symbol system such as the SECC suggests the sharing of some sort of belief system which lies behind and is manifest in the iconography. Such a belief system, like the iconography, must be beyond the boundaries of culture and the particulars of environmental adaptation. Ethnographic evidence from various groups across several centuries provides many clues to such similarities in beliefs, and the clearest focus for such commonalities is the structure of the cosmos. The belief that the world is layered appears to be universal across the Woodlands and Plains. That layered cosmos is inhabited by a fairly small number of Powers, most of whom are recognizable as they shift their forms and meanings from one group to another. Both the structural elements of the cosmos and the Powers which inhabit it, furthermore, have qualitative meanings, as is to be expected in a religious belief system. None of these insights is new, of course, but it is important to recall that the basic beliefs of an ancient North American international religion are already known, at least in the forms in which they yet survive. Thus an attempt to match some of them to an international iconographic system is not so great a conceptual leap, and, in fact, has been done before. This chapter is a consideration of the elements comprising a generalized cosmological model from the Woodlands and Plains, into which is incorporated an explication of iconographic elements that appear to be visual expressions of the beliefs. The crucial cosmological information is contained in mythology, in statements of belief, and in descriptions of ritual, all gathered through the last few centuries by ethnographers of varying trustworthiness. It is the argument of this chapter that in light of the knowledge of the cosmological beliefs of Native America, which is greater than is generally thought, these iconographic images are not as obscure as the visual presentation alone makes them seem. While the interpretations cannot be proved - what would constitute \"proof\" in iconographic study? - it is possible to present a strong case for them. This study seeks to identify some of the basic structural motifs of cosmology in the SECC images, as well as some of the nonhuman characters who inhabit that cosmos. Such a project could very quickly get out of hand, given the large number of images and visual motifs that are contained in the SECC, and it thus seems wise to limit the present demonstration to the interpretation of a few basic images. Therefore, two shell gorget designs will be the focus of this investigation, each of them found in a long series in the Tennessee River Valley and Etowah. They are known by type names assigned in this century on the basis of similarity of design. One, which has twenty-three known examples, is called the Cox Mound style (Fig. 2.1 [left]). The other, found in thirty examples, is called the Hixon style (Fig. 2.1 [right]) (Brain and Phillips 1996: 9-15). Interpreting these gorgets should take place on at least two levels. The focus in this chapter is on ideological content - to what empirical or conceptual realities do the elements of the designs refer? The second level, which is beyond the limits of the present chapter, is that of functional meaning - to what social uses are these iconographic images put? Who wears these gorgets, and what do they say about the wearer? The difference between the two realms of interpretation is important, because it is difficult to claim that a symbol has been exegeted properly until both realms have been explored. An analogous situation from Western history is the case of the Christian cross - an explanation of it in terms of the New Testament story of the crucifixion and its ramifications is an interpretation of the first type. There is, however, the meaning of the different forms of the cross (Maltese, St. Andrews, and so on) as signifiers of religious orders or national traditions, as well as the meaning of crosses as parts of personal insignia (rank in an order or priesthood, participation in a Crusade, and so on) - a set of interpretations which go far beyond the conceptual meaning of a religious philosophy. It seems fair to consider that engraved shell designs such as the Cox Mound style and the Hixon style, because they are represented in multiple forms and found in situ in graves as costume elements, should be examined from this twofold perspective of conceptual and functional meaning. Unfortunately, the brevity of this article limits the interpretation to the first realm only. The theses of this chapter can be listed briefly: (1) the two gorget styles are cosmological models, one a view from above, the other a side view; (2) both of the symbols and the field they occupy have meanings related to the believed structure of the cosmos and the cultural practices of the societies which created the images; and (3) those meanings, at least in the limited denotative sense described above, can be understood from beliefs, myths, and practices known from many different societies across the Eastern Woodlands and Plains, and they can be plausibly linked to the iconographic symbols. In order to present the support for these arguments, this chapter analyzes each of the two gorget styles in turn, with excursi into the ethnographic material at several points to bring into the discussion relevant religious understandings. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

To date, the arguments presented have either been based on qualitative analyses of the cores or on the use of ratios of linear measurements to infer the shape of the detached flakes. This paper presents the results of applying 2D geometric morphometric analysis to the flake assemblages in the archaeological collections from the O and M levels of the Abric Romaní rock-shelter and from materials produced by experimental knapping. The results reveal a pattern of core configuration in the Levallois artefacts from level O and a high level of morphological correspondence between the core-edge flake outlines in discoid and Levallois recurrent centripetal technologies. This evidence reinforces the hypothesis that the discoid and the Levallois recurrent centripetal methods share some techno-morphological features. The knappers\u0027 ability and the purposes of the reduction sequences play important roles in metrically differentiating between them, otherwise the differences between the two methods would be even smaller.

We applied a suite of organic geochemical tools to identify and quantify anthropogenic molecular charcoal fragments in an archaeological site in Panola County, N Texas to determine the provenance of a buried melanic horizon. The site is a small Middle-Late Caddo occupation inhabited principally between ca. 1450 and 1600 AD. We tested three molecular techniques to determine their ability to constrain site formation processes: solid state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), lignin free phenols and lignin oxidation products (LOPs) and anhydrosugar analysis. We demonstrated that, in conjunction, the three afforded the identification and quantification of anthropogenic molecular charcoal fragments at this archaeological site. The approach allowed reconstruction of the fire history and vegetation type around the site during the occupation period. The NMR and anhydrosugar analysis pointed to temperature conditions associated with thermal refuse in different contexts. In particular, geochemical signatures in a smudge pit indicated a higher combustion temperature than for the charcoals in the other paleosol samples, suggesting multiple fire uses. The data also showed differential persistence of fire signals in environmental samples, likely as a result of differential decomposition rate and solubility, which may lead to heterogeneous fates of different forms of pyrogenic C in the environment.

Black C was collected from 11 historical charcoal blast furnace sites with a geographic distribution from Quebec, Canada, to Georgia, USA, and compared to BC that was newly produced (new BC) using rebuilt historical kilns. The results showed that the historical BC samples were substantially oxidized after 130 years in soils as compared to new BC or BC incubated for one year. The major alterations by natural oxidation of BC included: (1) changes in elemental composition with increases in oxygen (O) from 7.2% in new BC to 24.8% in historical BC and decreases in C from 90.8% to 70.5%; (2) formation of oxygen-containing functional groups, particularly carboxylic and phenolic functional groups, and (3) disappearance of surface positive charge and evolution of surface negative charge after 12 months of incubation. Although time of exposure significantly increased natural oxidation of BC, a significant positive relationship between mean annual temperature (MAT) and BC oxidation (O/C ratio with r \u003d 0.83; P \u0026lt; 0.01) explained that BC oxidation was increased by 87 mmole kg C-1 per unit Celsius increase in MAT. This long-term oxidation was more pronounced on BC surfaces than for entire particles, and responded 7-fold stronger to increases in MAT. Our results also indicated that oxidation of BC was more important than adsorption of non-BC. Thus, natural oxidation of BC may play an important role in the effects of BC on soil biogeochemistry. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Natural oxidation of black carbon in soils: Changes in molecular form and surface charge along a climosequence","funding text 1":"We thank the Forges du Saint-Maurice National Historic Site (QC), Katahdin Iron Wroks (ME), Town of Port Henry (NY), The Friends of Beckley Furnace (CT), Greenwood Furnace State Park (PA), Hopewell Furnace National Historical Site, Oxford Furnace (NJ), The Ohio Historical Society (OH), Nassawango Iron Furnace (MD), Montgomery Bell State Park (TN), Iron Station (NC), Cooper’s Iron Works (GA) for permission us to take the soil and BC samples.

Our research builds on such applications to examine the organization of production by applying GM analysis to whole ceramic vessels from the Casas Grandes culture of northwest Mexico. We quantify variation in vessel shape and size and conclude that specialists made at least some of the Ramos and Babicora Polychromes, but that the other Casas Grandes ceramic types were generally made by nonspecialists. This bolsters arguments for Medio period (AD 1200 to 1450) specialized production above the household level but indicates that specialized production was limited to a subset of economically valuable goods. We further suggest some Ramos Polychrome was made by attached specialists associated with elites at Paquime, the religious center of the Medio period, whereas some Babicora Polychrome was made by independent specialists. The analysis contributes to three important anthropological topics: (1) the study of the Medio period Casas Grandes culture, and by extension the organization of production in mid-level hierarchically organized societies; (2) geometric morphometric analysis of archaeological collections; and (3) the Standardization Hypothesis and the relationship between artifact standardization and the organization of production.

Despite often numbering in the millions within a single field, their origin has been a mystery, with proposed explanations ranging from glacial processes to seismic shaking. One hypothesis proposes that mounds in North America are built by burrowing mammals to provide refuge from seasonally saturated soils. We test this hypothesis with a numerical model, parameterized with measurements of soil transport by gophers from a California mound field, that couples animal behavior with geomorphic processes. The model successfully simulates the development of the mounds as well as key details such as the creation of vernal pools, small intermound basins that provide habitat for endemic species. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the spatial structure of the modeled mound fields is similar to actual mound fields and provides an example of self-organized topographic features. We conclude that, scaled by body mass, Mima mounds are the largest structures built by nonhuman mammals and may provide a rare example of an evolutionary coupling between landforms and the organisms that create them. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","source":"Scopus","title":"Biotic origin for Mima mounds supported by numerical modeling","volume":"206","page start":"58","author(s) id":"6603903493;7004794838;7406820993;","document type":"Article","cited by":"24","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Bioturbation; Emergent features; Gophers; Self-organized","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Gabet E.J., Perron J.T., Johnson D.L.","doi":"10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.09.018"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":227.8560028076172,"y":-1028.265380859375,"id":"1113","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649317197","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Gouletquer P.L.","x":288.85430908203125,"y":-2444.27099609375,"id":"544","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84896377239","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1975","page end":"51","source title":"Salt: The Study of an Ancient Industry","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Niger, country of salt","page start":"47","cited by":"9","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Gouletquer P.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":-207.7431640625,"y":291.4310302734375,"id":"972","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85036708353","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2009","page end":"99","source title":"Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Ceramic comparisons between certain historic caddo sites in nacogdoches county","volume":"31","page start":"95","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Walker C.P., Perttula T.K.","x":-152.38314819335938,"y":353.0120849609375,"id":"948","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79951892056","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.0","year":"2010","page end":"322","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-79951892056\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2fsea.2010.29.2.007\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d27bbb0fd61b3adbce8e1e104dcf4cc9a","source title":"Southeastern Archaeology","abstract":"The J.

Our analysis aims at contributing to the ongoing debate regarding the origin and spread of agriculture in the peninsula by contrasting the dental evidence of archaeological and modern molecular samples. It is not possible to generalize given the complex and dynamic nature of these populations. However, the results from the principal component analysis, maximum likelihood, mean measure of divergence, and multidimensional scaling do indicate a net separation of the Paleo-Mesolithic sample from the other groups that is not related to dental reduction. This suggests that the shift in dental morphology was the product of Neolithic populations migrating into the peninsula from other areas. Nonetheless, the Paleo-Mesolithic populations share several discriminative traits with the Neolithic group. The biological relevance of such evidence suggests that, to some minor extent, the spread of agriculture did not occur by total population replacement. Because of regional small sample sizes, this hypothesis cannot be tested on a micro-regional scale.

This record of human occupation varies with the alluvial style of the river, resulting in each river valley having a unique archeological record controlled by three factors; location of occupation sites, preservation of those sites, and recognition of the sites. If problems of site preservation and recognition in a river valley can be recognized and addressed, a better insight into settlement patterns and complex human-environment interactions can result. This study represents a synthesis of extensive published and secondary data sets pertaining to archaeology and alluvial geomorphology of the lower Missouri, Red, and Mississippi Rivers, to examine the relationship of prehistoric site distribution with fluvial geomorphology. The archeologic data are from published literature and government agencies. The geomorphic data are from a variety of published and unpublished investigations, including maps of alluvial geomorphology, digital elevation models, aerial photographs, and topographic maps. The data were input into spreadsheets and a GIS for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Prehistoric human occupation of the narrow Missouri valley floor is limited, with only 0.061 recorded sites/km2. Additional sites are likely buried by thick vertical accretion sediment on the limited prehistoric portions of the floodplain and within alluvial/colluvial fans along the valley margin. Non-random preservation patterns, such as the absence of sites from the youngest cultural period, are attributed to shifts in settlement patterns. In comparison to the lower Missouri River valley, prehistoric occupation of the lower Red and Mississippi rivers was much more extensive and the density of occupation was 0.274 sites/km2 and 0.277 sites/km2 respectively. Significant differences do exist in the age of sites and their relationship to different floodplain depositional environments. Many sites along the active meander belt of the Red River were likely lost due to high rates of channel migration. Nevertheless, intense occupation of Paleo-Indian through Caddoan groups assures that many significant sites have been preserved. The wide valley and high rates of sedimentation suggest that many sites are likely buried, particularly along natural levees flanking an older meander belt. Recorded sites are also present along streams that incise the terrace, along the terrace margin, and along small channels that cross the backswamp. The spatial and temporal site distribution along the lower Mississippi valley is distinct in comparison with the Red River because the Mississippi valley is wider, the terraces are younger and less dissected, and the floodplain has more relief and is not broadly inundated by floodwater with relatively low sediment concentrations. Most of the significant Archaic through Mississippian period floodplain sites are located along the surfaces of abandoned Mississippi and distributary meander belts which aggraded above the adjacent backswamp and have rarely been influenced by flood sedimentation since abandonment. Abundant Paleo-Indian through Mississippian period sites are also widely distributed across undissected terraces. Only a few significant Mississippian sites are present along the active meander belt and in the backswamp where flooding was common. In comparison with the Red River, the archaeological record of the floodplain is less likely to be influenced by burial or erosion due to the Mississippi River having lower rates of overbank sedimentation and channel migration, respectively. The variable alluvial styles of the lower Missouri River, lower Red River, and the lower Mississippi River valleys presented varying opportunities and constraints to occupation and sustained settlement, and resulted in widely varying archaeological patterns that are partly dependent upon the alluvial geomorphology. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it has frequently been thought of as a \u0027large Levallois\u0027 variant. The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as \u0027large Levallois\u0027 is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison. The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n \u003d 639 artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1, Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker\u0027s Hole (UK), the Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while the Baker\u0027s Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores, Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but with its own distinct characteristics. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

After separating shape from overall size, position, and orientation of the landmark configurations, the resulting Procrustes shape coordinates can be used for statistical analysis. Kendall shape space, the mathematical space induced by the shape coordinates, is a metric space that can be approximated locally by a Euclidean tangent space. Thus, notions of distance (similarity) between shapes or of the length and direction of developmental and evolutionary trajectories can be meaningfully assessed in this space. Results of statistical techniques that preserve these convenient properties-such as principal component analysis, multivariate regression, or partial least squares analysis-can be visualized as actual shapes or shape deformations. The Procrustes distance between a shape and its relabeled reflection is a measure of bilateral asymmetry. Shape space can be extended to form space by augmenting the shape coordinates with the natural logarithm of Centroid Size, a measure of size in geometric morphometrics that is uncorrelated with shape for small isotropic landmark variation. The thin-plate spline interpolation function is the standard tool to compute deformation grids and 3D visualizations. It is also central to the estimation of missing landmarks and to the semilandmark algorithm, which permits to include outlines and surfaces in geometric morphometric analysis. The powerful visualization tools of geometric morphometrics and the typically large amount of shape variables give rise to a specific exploratory style of analysis, allowing the identification and quantification of previously unknown shape features. © The Author(s) 2009.","source":"Scopus","title":"Advances in Geometric morphometrics","funding text 1":"Acknowledgements We are grateful to Simon Huttegger, Astrid Jütte, and Matthew Skinner for valuable comments on the manuscript and thank Fred Bookstein, Dennis Slice, and Jim Rohlf for discussion.

It is common for researchers in these disciplines to work with multivariate phenotypic data. When phenotypic variables exceed the number of research subjects - data called \u0027high-dimensional data\u0027 - researchers are confronted with analytical challenges. Parametric tests that require high observation to variable ratios present a paradox for researchers, as eliminating variables potentially reduces effect sizes for comparative analyses, yet test statistics require more observations than variables. This problem is exacerbated with data that describe \u0027multidimensional\u0027 phenotypes, whereby a description of phenotype requires high-dimensional data. For example, landmark-based geometric morphometric data use the Cartesian coordinates of (potentially) many anatomical landmarks to describe organismal shape. Collectively such shape variables describe organism shape, although the analysis of each variable, independently, offers little benefit for addressing biological questions. Here we present a nonparametric method of evaluating effect size that is not constrained by the number of phenotypic variables, and motivate its use with example analyses of phenotypic change using geometric morphometric data. Our examples contrast different characterizations of body shape for a desert fish species, associated with measuring and comparing sexual dimorphism between two populations. We demonstrate that using more phenotypic variables can increase effect sizes, and allow for stronger inferences. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","source":"Scopus","title":"A method for analysis of phenotypic change for phenotypes described by high-dimensional data","funding text 1":"This research was supported by a Western Kentucky University Research and Creative Activities Program award (no. 12-8032) to MLC, an NSF REU (DBI 1004665) grant-funded research experience to DJS and NSF grant DEB-1257287 to DCA.

As an additional line of evidence for the growing body of botanical and faunal data, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bone collagen were analyzed from 82 human and faunal samples from the Arkansas basin and Ozark Highlands in eastern Oklahoma. The research investigates the role of maize in diets through time and across sex and status dimensions.

Although present prior to A.D. 1000 substantial increases in the use of maize do not begin until the Harlan phase (A.D. 1050-1250).

A qualitative estimation of vascular plant sources to the Saguenay Fjord shows that the sedimentary terrigenous plant material is comprised predominantly of gymnosperm woods. In the deeper sediment horizons of the upper Saguenay basin, low intensive lignin parameters (C/V and S/V) and high percentages of lignin to total sedimentary organic carbon (\u0026gt; 20%) all indicate elevated concentrations of woody gymnosperm tissues unprecedented in coastal sediments and directly related to the intense activity of the region\u0027s pulp and paper industries. The increased control on solid organic wastes from industrial effluents into the Saguenay fiver in the late 1980s to early 1990s is clearly apparent from increasing intensive parameter values and decreasing lignin fractions to the total sedimentary organic carbon (≃ 6-8%) in the upper basin surface sediments. Elemental and molecular analyses of fjord sediments, all indicate that most of the solid-phase discharge of lignified material by the pulp and paper industry is deposited rapidly close to the mouth of the river without reaching the downstream basins. In the St. Lawrence Estuary, intensive lignin parameters indicate that gymnosperm tissues are a major component of the sedimentary vascular plant material but with a significant fraction composed of angiosperm and nonwoody tissues. These latter types of organic tissues are particularly important components of terrigenous material in sediments deposited prior to the 1910-1920s. Acid/aldehyde ratios in most cores studied do not indicate clear-cut oxidative degradation of lignin material prior to its introduction in the aquatic system. The only exceptions are the two estuarine cores, where slightly elevated acid/aldehyde ratios relative to the range for fresh vascular plant tissues, might indicate mild aerobic fungal degradation of the sedimentary lignin material. Organic carbon, total nitrogen, organic phosphorus and lignin derived phenols all exhibited decreasing concentrations with core depth in the sediments of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary. First-order degradation rate constants for all four chemical categories ranged between 0.02-0.05 yr-1. The order of apparent reactivity among the different organic compounds is TN ≤C(org) \u0026gt; P(org) \u0026gt; lignin at the head of the Laurentian channel and lignin ≃ TN \u003d C(org) \u0026gt; P(org) further downstream. The surprising diagenetic selectivity observed at the upstream station is probably due to a higher flux of fresh, labile organic matter that reaches the sediment-water interface and degrades preferentially to more refractory materials such as lignin. Further downstream, little diagenetic selectivity was observed below the sediment-water interface indicating an overall refractory nature of the sedimentary organic matter. Finally, the differences in reactivity observed between C(org) and P(org) at both stations contradict earlier assumptions that no fractionation occurs between organic carbon and phosphorus during anaerobic degradation.","source":"Scopus","title":"Sources and early diagenesis of lignin and bulk organic matter in the sediments of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary and the Saguenay Fjord","funding text 1":"Financial support for laboratory and analytical expenses for this study was provided by NSERC through operating grants to the authors and a team grant from the Fonds de De’ueloppemenAtc adkmique du Rt%eau de I’Uniuersite du Que’bec (FODAR) attributedt o J-P.

Stable carbon isotope ratios of samples from both the eastern Ozarks and the Mississippi River alluvial valley indicate that human populations living prior to ca. A.D. 1000 consumed little or no C4 plant material. In populations dating after ca. A.D. 1000, stable carbon isotope ratios indicate that maize represented a significant part of the human diet throughout the region. The change in dietary patterns coincides with a shift in settlement patterns from dispersed hamlets and small villages to civic-ceremonial centers with associated villages, hamlets, and farmsteads. This isotopic evidence indicates that Emergent Mississippian diets did not include substantial quantities of maize or other C4 plant material. © The Society for American Archaeology 1986.","source":"Scopus","title":"Stable Carbon Isotopic Evidence for Maize Agriculture in Southeast Missouri and Northeast Arkansas","volume":"51","page start":"51","author(s) id":"14320390600;57214846559;55456790000;56852678500;","document type":"Review","cited by":"64","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Lynott M.J., Boutton T.W., Price J.E., Nelson D.E.","doi":"10.2307/280393"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Lacquement C.","x":731.1943969726562,"y":-273.618896484375,"id":"381","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84857586816","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2009","cited by":"9","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Landscape Modification at Moundville: An Energetics Assessment of A Mississippian Polity Unpublished Dissertation","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Lacquement C."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":-1151.14697265625,"y":-1234.96337890625,"id":"947","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84864273625","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1963","source title":"Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, Vol. VII, Laws","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"[No title available]","volume":"28","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":344.5242614746094,"y":-1001.1232299804688,"id":"1137","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649279307","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Webb W.S., DeJarnette D.L.","x":879.7169799804688,"y":2392.3779296875,"id":"507","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85054724922","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1942","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Webb W.S., DeJarnette D.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Corbin J.E., Hart J.P.","x":-422.4217834472656,"y":-717.9334716796875,"id":"882","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-43749099073","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1998","page end":"78","source title":"Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Thelite: A middle Caddo Mound complex in South Central East Texas","volume":"69","page start":"47","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Corbin J.E., Hart J.P."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Flad R.K.","x":549.8211669921875,"y":-2235.040283203125,"id":"526","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84924690390","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2011","page end":"285","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84924690390\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2fCBO9780511921094\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dd45f9af669e25884af73184b5f7bb27b","source title":"Salt Production and Social Hierarchy in Ancient China","abstract":"This book examines the organisation of specialised salt production at Zhongba, one of the most important prehistoric sites in the Three Gorges of China’s Yangzi River valley. Rowan K. Flad demonstrates that salt production emerged in the second millennium BCE and developed into a large-scale, intense activity. As the intensity of this activity increased during the early Bronze Age, production became more coordinated, perhaps by an emergent elite who appear to have supported their position of authority by means of divination and the control of ritual knowledge. This study explores evidence of these changes in ceramics, the layout of space at the site and animal remains. It synthesises the data retrieved from years of excavation, showing not only the evolution of production methods, but also the emergence of social hierarchy in the Three Gorges region over two millennia. © Rowan K.

The aim of this study was to explore and compare patterns of morphological covariation between the face and the lateral basicranium (anterior and middle cranial fossae) with covariation patterns between the face and the midline cranial base. Design: We employed 2D geometric morphometrics and partial least squares analysis to quantify and compare correlation coefficient between principal variation patterns between basicranial and facial structures in lateral radiographs from 143 humans from Japan (N \u003d 45), Europe (N \u003d 65) and Africa (N \u003d 34). Results: In both comparisons basicranial patterns co-varied with dolichofacial and brachyfacial morphologies. The findings showed that the midline cranial base is not significantly correlated of common facial patterns (r \u003d 0.37, P \u003d 0.09). Instead, the lateral basicranium is significantly (P \u003d 0.000), and significantly higher (r \u003d 0.6) correlated with facial variation than is the midline cranial base. Conclusions: The lateral basicranium may be of higher morphogenetic relevance for influencing facial variation than previously thought. This influence may be of clinical importance for the generation of skeletal class II or class III malocclusions. Further research should expand on geometric morphometric analysis of ontogenetic and clinical 3D data in order to advance in the understanding of these complex developmental relationships. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is argued here that salt production in this area developed largely in response to an increased demand for salt and salttreated commodities following European contact. Although numerous salt licks would have been known to the Caddo, only a fraction of these licks were involved in salt making. While there were likely many factors involved in determining which licks were favored over others, the availability and strength of liquid brine, resistance to flooding, fuel availability, and proximity to European traders would have been several important considerations.","source":"Scopus","title":"The timing and distribution of Caddo salt production in northwestern Louisiana","volume":"33","page start":"108","author(s) id":"56340784800;","index keywords":"archaeology; brine; commodity; prehistoric; salt dome; Louisiana; United States","document type":"Article","root":"true","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","pr_domain":"0.0","authors":"Eubanks P.N.","doi":"10.1179/sea.2014.33.1.007"},"color":"rgb(102,0,9)","size":50.0},{"label":"Bender M.M.","x":-2008.0264892578125,"y":-225.10960388183594,"id":"651","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0001341186","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1968","page end":"472","source title":"Radiocarbon","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Mass spectrometric studies of carbon 13 variations in corn and other grasses","volume":"10","page start":"468","cited by":"222","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Bender M.M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Milner G.R., Anderson D.G., Smith M.T.","x":501.47161865234375,"y":-575.575439453125,"id":"1202","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33847272414","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2001","page end":"18","source title":"Societies in Eclipse: Archaeology of the Eastern Woodlands Indians, A.

Reexamination of the data from Nagle reaffirms that this was principally a cemetery from a currently unidentified village, whereas previously unanalyzed materials from the Allcorn site suggest that this was a Caddoan village with associated cemetery. Radiocarbon dates from the Nagle site and relative dating of diagnostic materials from Allcorn suggest an occupation around A.D. 1200, toward the end of the Harlan phase or perhaps the beginning of the Norman phase. More in-depth analysis of materials from the two sites as well as surrounding Plains Village settlements do not support a previous argument that Arkansas River basin Caddoans in central Oklahoma were traders. It is argued that the presence of these Caddoan people was probably more related to religious and political practices.

Yet, possible confounding effects of familiarity with the car models, media coverage and entertainment could not be ruled out. In order to address this, the current study uses a cross-cultural comparison. Adult subjects in two countries (Austria and Ethiopia, n\u003d129) were asked to rate person characteristics of 46 standardized front views of automobiles on various trait scales. These two countries differ substantially with regard to their experience with car models and brands, as well as car marketing and media coverage. Geometric morphometrics was then used to assess the shape information underlying trait attribution. Car shapes for perceived maturity, maleness and dominance were highly similar in both countries, with patterns comparable to shape changes during facial growth in humans: Relative sizes of the forehead and windshield decrease with age/growth, eyes and headlights both become more slit-like, noses and grilles bigger, lips and air-intakes are wider. Austrian participants further attributed various degrees of some interpersonal attitudes and emotions, whereas neither Austrians nor Ethiopians congruently ascribed personalities. Morphological correlates of personal characteristics are discussed, as are person perception and its overgeneralization to inanimate objects. Cross-cultural similarities and differences are addressed, as well as implications for car styling, follow-up studies on driving and pedestrian behavior, and fundamental dimensions in inference from (human) faces. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","source":"Scopus","title":"\"Cars have their own faces\": Cross-cultural ratings of car shapes in biological (stereotypical) terms","funding text 1":"We thank our subjects; our two local assistants in Ethiopia, Kumelachew Alemu and Solomon Kebede; Desta Alemu for the Amharic and Oromo translations; Asamerew Dessie and his family for local support; and Horst Seidler for overall support.

A range of current methods for estimating the dates and durations of archaeological processes and events are considered, including visual inspection of graphs and tables of calibrated dates and the summing of the probability distributions of calibrated dates. These approaches are found wanting. The Bayesian statistical framework is introduced, and a worked example presents simulated radiocarbon dates as a demonstration of the explicit, quantified, probabilistic estimates now possible on a routine basis. Using this example, the reliability of the chronologies presented for the five long barrows considered in this series of papers is explored. It is essential that the \u0027informative\u0027 prior beliefs in a chronological model are correct. If they are not, the dating suggested by the model will be incorrect. In contrast, the \u0027uninformative\u0027 prior beliefs have to be grossly incorrect before the outputs of the model are importantly wrong. It is also vital that the radiocarbon ages included in a model are accurate, and that their errors are correctly estimated. If they are not, the dating suggested by a model may also be importantly wrong. Strenuous effort and rigorous attention to archaeological and scientific detail are inescapable if reliable chronologies are to be built.

Complicating factors include dealing with temper and amassing background data from potential source areas. Because freshwater mussels incorporate elements into their shells in proportion to the chemical makeup of waterways, hypothetically the drainage of origin could be determined for shell-tempered pottery by chemically analyzing the temper particles. A chemical analysis of whole-shell samples is presented which indicates that separation by drainage is possible. Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) provides a rapid, precise, and essentially nondestructive way to analyze shell-temper particles without having to remove them from the sherd. A pilot study employing LA-ICP-MS on shell-tempered ceramics from Lyon\u0027s Bluff (22OK520), a late prehistoric/Protohistoric period site in northeast Mississippi, suggests that while some stylistically exotic artifacts appear to be imports, others appear to have been made locally. These results, although preliminary in terms of sourcing ceramics from the site, are useful in introducing the method and for discussing procedural considerations arising from the study.","source":"Scopus","title":"Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to source shell in shell-tempered pottery: A pilot study from North Mississippi","volume":"26","page start":"319","author(s) id":"14043886900;7005907495;23570088200;57205430177;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; artifact; ceramics; chemical composition; inductively coupled plasma method; prehistoric; provenance; Mississippi; North America; United States","document type":"Article","cited by":"17","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Peacock E., Neff H., Rafferty J., Meaker T."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Rogers J.D.","x":537.6464233398438,"y":-627.3875122070312,"id":"1240","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0345835990","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1982","cited by":"3","source title":"Spiro Archaeology: 1980 Research","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Rogers J.D."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Perttula T.K., Ferguson J.R.","x":-232.9972686767578,"y":-1191.5284423828125,"id":"351","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84899880858","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Special Publication No. 17","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"The chemical variation in prehistoric and early historic caddo ceramics in Eastern Texas","authors":"Perttula T.K., Ferguson J.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Schultz T.C., Walker C.P., Creel D., Hudler D., Wilson S.M.","x":-81.20433807373047,"y":-63.25871276855469,"id":"1302","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-49349105482","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2004","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","source title":"69th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00796812749003984","title":"Magnetometer Survey and Intrasite Structure of an Early Caddo Site","authors":"Schultz T.C., Walker C.P., Creel D., Hudler D., Wilson S.M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Dalan R.A.","x":813.44970703125,"y":-267.209228515625,"id":"365","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0013310420","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1997","page end":"102","source title":"Cahokia: Domination and Ideology in the Mississippian World","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The Construction of Mississippian Cahokia","page start":"89","cited by":"32","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Dalan R.A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Buchmann N., Brooks J.R., Rapp K.D., Ehleringer J.R.","x":-2224.080078125,"y":-103.7407455444336,"id":"658","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0030063197","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1996","page end":"402","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0030063197\u0026doi\u003d10.1111%2fj.1365-3040.1996.tb00331.x\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003de4b9304684a166ba9015b7d1a7b923f5","source title":"Plant, Cell and Environment","abstract":"The carbon isotope composition of C4 grasses has the potential to be used as an indicator of changes in the isotopic composition and concentration of atmospheric CO2, especially for climate reconstruction. The usefulness of C4 grasses for this purpose hinges on the assumption that their photosynthetic discrimination against 13C remains constant in a wide range of environmental conditions. We tested this assumption by examining the effects of light and water stress on the carbon isotope composition of C4 grasses using different biochemical subtypes (NADP-ME, NAD-ME, PCK) in glasshouse experiments. We grew 14 different C4 grass species in four treatments: sun-watered, sun-drought, shade-watered and shade-drought. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) rarely remained constant. In general, Δ values were lowest in sun-watered grasses, greater for sun-drought plants and even higher for plants of the shade-watered treatment. The highest Δ values were generally found in the most stressed grasses, the shade-drought plants. Grasses of the NADP-ME subtype were the least influenced by a change in environmental variables, followed by PCK and NAD-ME subtypes. Water availability affected the carbon isotope discrimination less than light limitation in PCK and NAD-ME subtypes, but similarly in NADP-ME subtypes. In another experiment, we studied the effect of increasing light levels (150 to 1500 μmol photons m-2 s-1) on the Δ values of 18 well-watered C4 grass species. Carbon isotope discrimination remained constant until photon flux density (PFD) was less than 700 μmol photons m-2 s-1. Below this light level, Δ values increased with decreasing irradiance for all biochemical subtypes. The change in Δ was less pronounced in NADP-ME and PCK than in NAD-ME grasses. Grasses grown in the field and in the glasshouse showed a similar pattern. Thus, caution should be exercised when using C4 plants under varying environmental conditions to monitor the concentration or carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 in field/glasshouse studies or climate reconstruction.","source":"Scopus","title":"Carbon isotope composition of C4 grasses is influenced by light and water supply","volume":"19","page start":"392","author(s) id":"7003333258;7402788471;36842349900;7005417981;","document type":"Article","cited by":"117","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"C4 grasses; Carbon isotope; Climate reconstruction; Discrimination; Global change; Light; Water; δ13C","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Buchmann N., Brooks J.R., Rapp K.D., Ehleringer J.R.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-3040.1996.tb00331.x"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Turner R.L., Smith III J.E., Perttula T.K., Nelson B., Walters M., Gonzalez B.","x":-2267.150390625,"y":-328.843994140625,"id":"723","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84897477878","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2002","page end":"68","source title":"Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The Harold Williams Site (41CP10) and the Texas Archeological Society Field School of 1967","volume":"73","page start":"1","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Turner R.L., Smith III J.E., Perttula T.K., Nelson B., Walters M., Gonzalez B."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":227.93753051757812,"y":-125.74365234375,"id":"1181","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649316879","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00398406374501992","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Perttula T.K., Walker C.P.","x":92.60222625732422,"y":229.7571258544922,"id":"1008","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79951928406","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2008","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The History of Archaeological Investigations and Geophysical Survey at the Jamestoivn Mound Site (41SM54), An Archaeological Conservancy Preserve in Smith County, Texas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Perttula T.K., Walker C.P."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Robinson W.S.","x":477.3764343261719,"y":242.0869598388672,"id":"1310","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-70350573233","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1951","page end":"301","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-70350573233\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f276978\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003daadbe05a6d357b7e5762d864338ff52b","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"The statistical technique of this paper is based upon the empirically established fact that over the course of time pottery types come into and go out of general use by a given group of people.

Many types of axe have been identified, some of which have numerous variant forms. In the current French terminology, all axes are divided into two generic groups: namely \"Atlantic\" (Atlantique) and \"Eastern\" (Orientale). Each of these generic groups, however, is highly polymorphic, so that it is often very difficult for the operator to classify individual axes with absolute confidence and certainty. In order to overcome such problems, a new shape classification is proposed, using morphometric analysis (Elliptic Fourier Analysis) followed by unsupervised model-based clustering and discriminant analysis, both based on Gaussian mixture modelling. Together, these methods produce a clearer pattern, which is independently validated by the spatial distribution of the findings, and multinomial scan statistics. This approach is fast, reproducible, and operator-independent, allowing artefacts of unknown membership to be classified rapidly. The method is designed to be amendable by the introduction of new artefacts, in the light of future discoveries. This method can be adapted to suit many other archaeological artefacts, providing information about the material, social and cultural relations of ancient populations. © 2015.","source":"Scopus","title":"Unsupervised model-based clustering for typological classification of Middle Bronze Age flanged axes","volume":"3","page start":"381","author(s) id":"56272838100;7003488151;36902120100;8335515700;56717376600;23484256000;","document type":"Article","cited by":"5","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Archaeology; Bronze age; Closed contour; Elliptic fourier analysis; Flanged axes; Gaussian mixture modelling; Morphometrics; Self-organizing maps; Typology","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Wilczek J., Monna F., Gabillot M., Navarro N., Rusch L., Chateau C.","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2015.06.030"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Shillito L.-M., Matthews W.","x":-1859.849609375,"y":2176.597412109375,"id":"327","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84870889751","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"1","year":"2013","page end":"49","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84870889751\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fgea.21427\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003df5907f5688ee1ab2e5c6908d1e4cad89","source title":"Geoarchaeology","abstract":"Anthropogenic midden deposits are remarkably well preserved at the Neolithic settlement of Çatalhöyük and provide significant archaeological information on the types and nature of activities occurring at the site.

In different regions, they are known by different labels (e.g. Bromme points, Lyngby points, and Teyjat points) and are often given culturally and hence chronologically diagnostic status as important fossiles directeurs, especially in northern Europe. The vast majority of these finds are from the surface or derive from less-than-secure contexts. Several recent papers have cast doubt on the validity of this artefact class as a taxonomically sensitive marker. Here, we further investigate this issue using 2D geometric morphometric techniques on a sample of published large tanged points from several key sites in northern Europe. This analysis reveals a substantial amount of shape variation within this artefact class and finds no support for distinctions between large tanged points derived from different cultural and/or chronological contexts. Our analysis thus strongly supports the notion that large tanged points do not function as useful culturally diagnostic marker artefacts. The earliest occurrences of Final Palaeolithic large tanged points date to late GS-2 or GI-1e (~. 15,000-14,000 cal BP), alongside arch-backed points. Their presence in later assemblages and technocomplexes such as the Brommean cannot therefore be considered as a derived or diagnostic feature. We suggest that this artefact class should rather be linked to weapon systems function (dart-points) different from the coeval arch-backed points (arrowheads) and that definitions of cultures based on these should thus be taken up for critical revision. © 2016 The Authors.","source":"Scopus","title":"2D geometric morphometric analysis casts doubt on the validity of large tanged points as cultural markers in the European Final Palaeolithic","volume":"9","page start":"150","author(s) id":"57190305972;23010055400;","document type":"Article","cited by":"8","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Bromme culture; Final Palaeolithic; Geometric morphometrics; Large tanged points; Projectile points","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Serwatka K., Riede F.","doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.07.018"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Stuiver M., Reimer P.J., Reimer R.","x":148.44989013671875,"y":-1026.319091796875,"id":"1082","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33845751810","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2005","cited by":"349","publication stage":"Final","source title":"CALIB Radiocarbon Calibration","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Stuiver M., Reimer P.J., Reimer R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":-120.99147033691406,"y":-48.758358001708984,"id":"1306","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-49349102169","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1962","source title":"Handbook of Texas Archeology: Type Descriptions","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"[No title available]","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00796812749003984","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Louchouarn P., Amon R.M.W., Duan S., Pondell C., Seward S.M., White N.","x":-1709.97607421875,"y":2294.01416015625,"id":"317","attributes":{"funding details":"National Science Foundation, NSF: ARC 0713991, ARC 0425582\n\nTexas A and M University, TAMU","eid":"2-s2.0-71849100629","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"1-2","year":"2010","page end":"97","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-71849100629\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.marchem.2009.11.003\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003de7cbc81c581368743175b723915e7e7f","source title":"Marine Chemistry","abstract":"A series of reference materials are proposed for intercomparison and quality control purposes during the quantification of lignin oxidation products (LOP) from diverse environmental matrices. These materials are all easily accessible and certified for diverse organic constituents (NIST and IHSS). They represent a suite of natural environmental matrices (from solids to aqueous) and are characterized by a wide range of organic carbon and lignin concentrations with abundant proportions of all major LOP. The variability of LOP concentrations and signatures for all these materials averages 3-5% and does not exceed 10%. Using these standards, a new quantification method was developed and validated for the determination of low-level CuO oxidation products using capillary gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS-MS). Tandem mass spectrometry provides both the high sensitivity and selectivity required for the identification and quantification of trace levels of dissolved lignin. The method is particularly useful for removing interference from co-eluting isotopes generated from the DOM matrix and during glucose amendment procedures of low-carbon samples. Such glucose amendment is not necessary, however, when the CuO to organic carbon weight-to-weight ratio can be kept at a value \u003c 200-300. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents the results of a dedicated monitoring programme conducted over 2 years and at a catchment scale in South West England. The land use of the nine sub-catchments monitored was determined using Landsat Thematic Data. At two stations, pollen and spore sampling through storm hydrographs was undertaken whilst at the other 7 sub-catchments only peak flow samples were collected. Samples were also collected from re-suspended bed material, riverbanks and at low flows. Airborne pollen flux was monitored using modified Tauber traps. The results support previous research illustrating how the vast majority of fluvial pollen and spores are transported during floods (in this case 91%) and that the main control on waterborne pollen and spore assemblages is the catchment vegetation. However, strong seasonal effects are shown as well as the importance of distinctive sources, such as the riparian input, bed re-suspension and overland flow into drains and tributaries. Fine sediment in river pools appears to act as a selective store of damaged cereal-type pollen grains in arable catchments and this can reduce the inherent underestimate of arable land from pollen diagrams with a high fluvial input and increase the visibility of early agriculture. In order to simulate the likely result of a flood-dominated influx to a small lake scenario, modelling was undertaken whereby different sub-catchments were substituted in order to represent changes in catchment vegetation under a constant hydrological regime. The results show the dampened response of land use groups to catchment land use change, and the frequent occurrence of anomalous single-level peaks due to seasonal flushes from specific near-stream vegetation types. Both these features are commonly seen in lake pollen diagrams. Fluvial pollen and spore loading is dependant upon discharge and so concentrations in laminated or varved sediments could be regarded as a proxy for flood magnitude. The implications for this study on the interpretation of lake and near-shore marine pollen and spore diagrams are discussed and it is argued that a more quantitative approach to waterborne pollen could improve the estimation of land use from lakes in the temperate zone. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It is becoming clear that the spread and intensification of maize agriculture relates to the dissemination of Mississippian cultural traits in a variety of ways, rather than through a set trajectory. In this article, we focus on the Caddo, who have been postulated to have subsisted on smaller amounts of maize than other Mississippian-like groups to their east and northeast. The use of stable isotope analysis provides a direct means of comparing the amounts of maize consumed among various Mississippian-related cultures. We synthesize the results of Caddo stable isotope studies to compare the process of maize agricultural intensification among the Caddo to other archaeological cultures that shared Mississip- pian traits. We find that the Caddo consumed less maize throughout the prehistoric sequence than their neighbors.

It is apparent that while the use of geophysical techniques is at an all-time high, there are many key areas where prospecting is rapidly developing. Some of the advances relate to fundamental aspects of the techniques, while others dictate how we undertake survey in the future. There is a movement away from pre-gridded survey areas towards real-time GPS for navigation. This allows greater integration, or fusion, of disparate data sources using visualization techniques derived from associated disciplines. The analysis of landscapes has become a major component of the application of new technology and there are many challenges to be tackled, including how to analyse and interpret significant archaeology within large-scale, data-rich, multi-technique investigations.

It encompasses the posterior projection/convexity of the occipital squama and is associated with lambdoid flattening on the parietal. A \u0027hemibun\u0027 in some Upper Paleolithic Europeans is thought by some authors to indicate interbreeding between Neanderthals and early modern Europeans. However, \u0027bunning\u0027 is difficult to measure, and the term has been applied to a range of morphological patterns. Furthermore, its usefulness in phylogenetic reconstruction and its homologous status across modern and fossil humans have been disputed. We present a geometric morphometric study that quantitatively evaluates the chignon, assesses its usefulness in separating Neanderthals from modern humans, and its degree of similarity to Upper Paleolithic \u0027hemibuns.\u0027 We measured the three-dimensional coordinates of closely spaced points along the midsagittal plane from bregma to inion and of anatomical landmarks in a large series of recent human crania and several Middle and Late Pleistocene European and African fossils. These coordinate data were processed using the techniques of geometric morphometrics and analyzed with relative warps, canonical variates, and singular warps. Our results show no separation between Neanderthals and modern humans, including early modern Europeans, when the shape of the occipital plane midsagittal-profile is considered alone. On the other hand, Neanderthals are well separated from both recent and fossil modern humans when information about the occipital\u0027s relative position and relative size are also included. Furthermore, the occurrence of a highly convex and posteriorly projecting midline occipital profile (interpreted as the occipital bun) is highly correlated (\u003e0.8) with a flat parietal midsagittal profile and with antero-superiorly positioned temporal bones across both our recent and our fossil human samples. We conclude that the shape of the occipital profile alone should not be considered an independent trait, as it is very tightly integrated with braincase shape. Our analysis does not support differences in integration of the posterior midsagittal profile and the cranial base in Pleistocene and recent humans. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Dispersed Hopewell tribes foraged for food and harvested native cultigens. Seasonal feasts at earthworks helped integrate the dispersed populations. Mississippian subsistence cycles are reflected in the seasonal abundance of deposited floral and faunal remains. Pits filled in spring/summer have many fish, but few deer bones. Deer remains are abundant, but fish are rare, in pits filled during the fall/winter. Finding few deer remains in some pits at Cahokia may not mean that deer were scarce but may mean that few deer were hunted during the seasons when those trash pits were filled. Stable isotope values in human burials, analyses of floral and faunal remains from pits and middens filled throughout the year, and diachronic studies of deer size and herd stability indicate that the Cahokia elite consumed a variety of foods including substantial amounts of fish and venison. Patterns in deer element distributions in \"elite\" and \"non-elite\" contexts suggest that venison may have been part of the tribute that was presented to high-status Cahokians.

Most studies focus on the refractory end of the PyC spectrum, derived from middle- to high-temperature combustion. Low-temperature PyC is produced during wildfires and has been found to be particularly labile and water soluble. Here we find that in each of the major Siberian watersheds, low-temperature fire-derived biomarkers are present in detectable concentrations during all flow regimes of the 2004-2006 sampling period, confirming that PyC is an intrinsic component of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool mobilized by hydrologic events. Gymnosperm combustion, from the southern portions of these watersheds, is the primary source of this Py-DOC input. Using first-order degradation rates and transit times of water through these rivers, about half of the total estimated flux of this material may be remineralized during transport from fire source to river mouth (20-40-days), demonstrating the input of a labile source of PyC to these watersheds. © 2015.

Images of this bird have given rise to more interpretive interest than perhaps any other (e.g., Brown 1975, Emerson 1997, Strong 1989). However, the scope of that interest has remained limited to traits intrinsic to the living hawk. Missing is serious consideration of ideological associations independent of the bird\u0027s biological or ecological attributes. It is these ideological associations that connect importantly with Mississippian Period political economy. We need not look far to find a rich source of culturally constructed meanings. A particularly useful case comes from the Osage of the Prairie Plains, where the sacred Wa-xobe is the \"symbolic hawk.\" This hawk or falcon is simultaneously an avatar of warriors in combat and an object for supplication, not merely to ensure success or failure on the field of battle, but more essentially to ensure a lengthy life, a healthy family, and a long line of descendants (La Flesche 1939: 9-13, 85-86). As reinforcement for this symbolic bird\u0027s less-than-obvious significance, its origin is placed supernaturally in the sky among a pantheon of the sun, the moon, and four stars (La Flesche 1921: 63, 1930: 603). There is nothing intrinsic about these heavenly connections. Nor are they arbitrary; rather, these associations are an essential part of a carefully articulated cosmology. For humans the hawk is a symbolic source of supernatural gifts of health, longevity, and a long line of descendants. The bird is merely an exemplar of the theme, not the theme itself. What follows is an attempt to transport the ideological essentials of the falcon theme of recent, post-contact time back six hundred to seven hundred years earlier, to a seminal period in the history of Cahokia when the falcon imagery found elaborate figural expression. The burden of the iconographic argument is to stress the logical durability of the falcon theme as a charter for key social statuses in a range of different political economies. Signature characteristics of the theme are its association of life\u0027s chances with high-stakes gaming, the triumphant return of life with the pre-dawn appearance of the morning star, and the flight of the arrow as a metaphor for the succession of generations into the future. All or a combination of these constitute essential features of the theme in Southeastern myth. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

Numerous innovations have improved the acoustical properties and payability of violins. Yet, other attributes of the violin affect its performance less, and with fewer constraints, are potentially more sensitive to historical vagaries unrelated to quality. Although the coarse shape of violins is integral to their design, details of the body outline can vary without significantly compromising sound quality. What can violin shapes tell us about their makers and history, including the degree that luthiers have influenced each other and the evolution of complex morphologies over time? Here, I provide an analysis of morphological evolution in the violin family, sampling the body shapes of over 9,000 instruments over 400 years of history. Specific shape attributes, which discriminate instruments produced by different luthiers, strongly correlate with historical time. Linear discriminant analysis reveals luthiers who likely copied the outlines of their instruments from others, which historical accounts corroborate. Clustering of averaged violin shapes places luthiers into four major groups, demonstrating a handful of discrete shapes predominate in most instruments. Violin shapes originating from multi-generational luthier families tend to cluster together, and familial origin is a significant explanatory factor of violin shape. Together, the analysis of four centuries of violin shapes demonstrates not only the influence of history and time leading to the modern violin, but widespread imitation and the transmission of design by human relatedness. © 2014 Daniel H.

In both instances, levoglucosan concentrations in the different versions of the Washington, D.C. urban dust standard (SRM 1649, 1649a, 1649b, and RM 8785) were similar. The present test also showed that levoglucosan concentrations were not affected by long-term shelf storage of dry material. Variability of analyses were similar for both surrogates and averaged \u0026lt;5%. Surrogate recoveries were shown to average 103 ± 7% and 97 ± 7% for d7-levoglucosan and sedoheptulosan, respectively. The choice of solvent was shown to affect recoveries the most (but not variability). Levoglucosan concentrations were either seriously underestimated or overestimated with ethyl acetate extraction when d7-levoglucosan or sedoheptulosan was used as surrogate, respectively. These results point to the need to use some fraction of polar solvent (i.e. methanol) in the solvent mixture. Anhydrosugar concentrations in the urban dust from the Czech Republic (candidate SRMs 2786 and 2787) were characterized by 3- to 7-fold higher anhydrosugar concentrations than those observed in the Washington, D.C. urban dust. The internal anhydrosugar signatures (i.e. levoglucosan/mannosan ratio: L/M) confirm the predominance of biomass combustion sources in both SRM series with mixed inputs from hardwood and softwood combustion in the Washington, D.C. urban dust and a predominantly softwood source in the Prague urban dust. The uniform distribution of anhydrosugars, across the particle size distribution of both SRM series, confirms earlier studies that low temperature charred materials contribute significant inputs to atmospheric ultrafine particles with long atmospheric residence time and transport ranges. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Determination of levoglucosan and its isomers in size fractions of aerosol standard reference materials","funding text 1":"We thank two anonymous reviewers whose comments greatly improved the manuscript.

That question can best be addressed by first documenting the dynamics of changing \"wet\" cycles during the Holocene in the central Mexican region between the northern limits of Pre-Hispanic agriculture and its southern margins in northwestern Chihuahua. Consequently the Laguna Project targeted a 125,000 km2 sector of North-Central Mexico, 250 km from north to south and 500 km from east to west, from Saltillo to Durango. Some 40 sedimentary profiles with multiple cumulic soils were studied in the field and laboratory, supported by 163 conventional 14C and AMS dates on charcoal and soil humates. We distinguish: (1) wet floodplains (with humic paleosols, redox phenomena reflecting high water tables, channel-ponding sequences, and interbedded tufas) that imply aquifer recharge, sustained base flow, and mainly low-energy conditions; and (2) high-energy pulses of discharge that mobilized cobble gravels or forced channel entrenchment (\"gullying\") and were tied to episodic, excessive rains that promoted valley and slope instability. In between such \"wet\" cycles and recurrent disequilibrium events, climate was similar to today, probably less humid, with limited geomorphologic change or slow soil formation. \"Wet\" cycles were rare at the end of the Pleistocene, but prominent during the Holocene. Disequilibrium proxies became common and dramatic after 2500 BP. The drainages from the Eastern and Western Sierra Madres responded in phase, but varied in detail. Around AD 1050-1200 \"natural\" erosion led to loss of soil organic carbon, as alternating severe droughts and heavy rains destroyed the ground cover and led to ecological aridification, well before arrival of Spanish miners and settlers. The evidence that human activity triggered Pre-Hispanic or Colonial erosion in Central Mexico should therefore be re-evaluated. Global comparisons and interpretations are discussed, but with caution, since no single theory can explain the whole of the record. The soil-geomorphology geoarchive of North-Central Mexico primarily is an environmental history of alternating \"wet\" cycles, rather than of sustained wet or dry climates. The critical differences between \"soaking\" and \"excessive\" rains, with their respective impacts, may be due to switching between winter and summer storm categories. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This practice results in confusions when large-scale assemblage comparisons are made with the aim of investigating phylogenetic relationships, as functional and cultural information is aggregated. It is argued here that functional criteria must be assessed separately, and that resharpening, as a uniform, repeated, conscious behavioral process of tool maintenance that indexes use and function, can provide a solution to this problem. The subject of this article is a quantitative method for extracting and comparing resharpening trajectories. The method is an adaptation of ontogenetic scaling methods from biology, and is based on obtaining a mathematical representation of shape and size, and finding a relationship between the two. Elliptical Fourier analysis is applied to stone tool contours in order to extract shape information, and then a series of regressions of shape on size provide trajectory vectors. The angles between these are then calculated and subjected to a variety of multivariate statistical tests. A case study involving several European Middle Paleolithic bifacial and unifacial tool assemblages is presented. The results show that resharpening and maintenance can be independent of morphology and technology, suggesting that there are strong grounds for focusing on functional systematics separately. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A set of tropical inbred lines and their hybrids were grown in the field for 2 yr under three different water regimes. First-year plant water use was evaluated by measuring instantaneous traits (stomatal conductance (gs) and steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs)) in individual leaves together with time-integrative traits, which included mineral accumulation in the whole leaves of plants and oxygen isotope enrichment above source water (Δ18O) and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in the same pooled leaves and in mature kernels. Second-year water use was evaluated by measuring leaf temperature, gs and relative water content (RWC). Within each growing condition, hybrids showed higher Fs, mineral accumulation, RWC, and lower leaf temperature, Δ18O and Δ13C than inbred lines. Therefore, hybrids had a better water status than inbred lines, regardless of the water conditions. Differences in grain yield across growing conditions were explained by differences in water-use traits, with hybrids and inbred lines following a common pattern. Within each growing condition, most variations in grain yield, between hybrids and inbred lines, were also explained by differences in plant water-use traits. Heterosis in tropical maize seems to be mediated by improved water use, irrespective of the water conditions during growth. © The Authors (2010).

However, inorganic C present in the soil as carbonates will interfere with the measurement of soil organic 13C unless removed or excluded from measurement. We report a simple and convenient HCl-fumigation method to remove inorganic C from soil. Soil samples are weighed in Ag-foil capsules, arranged on a microtiter plate, wetted with water to approximately field capacity, and placed in a desiccator containing a beaker with concentrated (12 M) HCl. The carbonates are released as CO2 by the acid treatment in 6 to 8 h. The soil samples are then dried at 60°C prior to isotope determination. The advantages of the HCl-fumigation method to remove inorganic C from the soil are that: (i) no water soluble C will be lost from the soil; (ii) a large number of samples can be processed simultaneously; (iii) the removal of inorganic C is rapid and complete; and (iv) the method could also be used to determine both organic and inorganic C content in the soil. A potential disadvantage, however, is that the HCl fumigation changed the 15N natural abundance of soil N.","source":"Scopus","title":"Acid fumigation of soils to remove carbonates prior to total organic carbon or carbon-13 isotopic analysis","volume":"65","page start":"1853","author(s) id":"57190549434;7004195403;55663161900;","index keywords":"Carbon; Carbonates; Fumigation; Hydrochloric acid; Isotopes; Silver; Microtiter plates; Soils; carbonate; fumigation; hydrochloric acid; isotopic analysis; organic carbon; soil carbon","document type":"Article","cited by":"581","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Harris D., Horwáth W.R., Van Kessel C."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Early A.M.","x":696.9572143554688,"y":1694.956298828125,"id":"259","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84900880978","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2012","page end":"46","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84900880978\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d1f1627a8a4098797dbbfd9252d7cb282","source title":"The Archaeology of the Caddo","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Form and structure in prehistoric Caddo pottery design","page start":"26","author(s) id":"56051113100;","document type":"Book Chapter","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Early A.M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Braadbaart F., Poole I., van Brussel A.A.","x":-1737.046142578125,"y":2328.264892578125,"id":"301","attributes":{"funding details":"815.01.005","eid":"2-s2.0-67349086890","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"8","year":"2009","page end":"1679","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-67349086890\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2009.03.006\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003df11f16a1392a91346d008facf6fc5e66","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Charcoalified plant material (usually wood) has been described as being inert with a high preservation potential. Although usually black on both the outside and inside, the physical and chemical properties differ as a function of temperature and time of exposure to a heat source. Post-depositional processes however may exert additional affects on charcoalified material and introduce bias into the archaeological record. This work explores the influence of alkaline conditions, often encountered in the soil environment, on the preservation potential of charcoalified material. Charcoal, experimentally produced at different temperatures, was exposed to a number of solutions of potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide with different pHs, to simulate exposure to alkaline soil conditions. Under these conditions chemically mediated physical interactions occur resulting in fragmentation of the charcoal samples into (very) small pieces the size of which depends upon the initial temperature of charcoalification. Moreover further interactions result in a decrease in reflectance relative to samples not exposed to alkaline conditions. Although experimentally driven the potential for physical loss of charcoal from a particular site coupled with the reduction in (expected) reflectance of any resident material, has important implications for any conclusions drawn regarding the archaeological record. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We modified the median axis technique to define novel measurements, which proved complementary to those obtained from conventional landmarks. Allometric analyses showed that the scaling of the mandible among the New World tree squirrels is generally isometric (as has been observed in other groups of mammals), but diverges from isometry in a tendency in smaller animals for the masseteric ridge to be displaced anteriorly, the condylar process and posterior portion of the ascending ramus to be relatively elongated, and the coronoid process to be shortened. Allometric analyses also revealed the ways and extent that outgroup taxa deviated from the scaling pattern observed for the New World tree squirrels. A flying squirrel (subfamily Pteromyinae), a moderate-sized callosciurine squirrel, and three species of pygmy tree squirrels from Asia and Africa show mandibular proportions very similar to those predicted for New World tree squirrels of corresponding size. Ground squirrels (tribe Marmotini) and successively more distant relatives such as Aplodontia, two myomorph rodents, and a rabbit show greater differences from the New World tree squirrels in their mandibular proportions. Combining the use of median-axis and conventional measurements makes it possible to examine changing relationships between locations of anatomically homologous landmarks and the geometry of the form.","source":"Scopus","title":"Scaling of the mandible in squirrels","volume":"232","page start":"107","author(s) id":"6506883938;7005561322;","index keywords":"animal; article; Arvicolinae; classification; histology; mandible; masseter muscle; phylogeny; rabbit; rat; reproducibility; Sciuridae; statistical model; temporalis muscle; Animals; Arvicolinae; Logistic Models; Mandible; Masseter Muscle; Phylogeny; Rabbits; Rats; Reproducibility of Results; Sciuridae; Temporal Muscle; Animalia; Aplodontia; Mammalia; Muridae; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Petauristinae; Pteromyinae; Rodentia; Sciuridae; Sciurus; Spermophilus","document type":"Article","cited by":"40","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Velhagen W.A., Roth V.L.","doi":"10.1002/(SICI)1097-4687(199705)232:2\u003c107::AID-JMOR1\u003e3.0.CO;2-7"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":786.5680541992188,"y":-65.15184783935547,"id":"414","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039607336","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2013","source title":"70th Meeting of the Southeastern Archaeological Conference","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Early mississippian mortuary practices in the arkansas river drainage of Eastern Oklahoma","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Knight V.J.","x":775.154052734375,"y":-127.08367919921875,"id":"358","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84944765699","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1986","page end":"687","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84944765699\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f280859\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d96738f7820ac59c69d3d36855284e9e5","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"Symbolic objects for ceremonial display, or sacra, tend to be systematically related in their representational content to the cult institutions that produce and manipulate them.

Projecting a phylogeny into morphospace provides estimates of evolutionary trajectories as lineages diversified information that can be used to infer the dynamics of evolutionary processes that produced patterns of morphospace occupation. We present here a large-scale investigation into evolution of morphological variation in the skull of caecilian amphibians, a major clade of vertebrates. Because caecilians are limbless, predominantly fossorial animals, diversification of their skull has occurred within a framework imposed by the functional demands of head-first burrowing. We examined cranial shape in 141 species, over half of known species, using X-ray computed tomography and geometric morphometrics. Mapping an existing phylogeny into the cranial morphospace to estimate the history of morphological change (phylomorphospace), we find a striking pattern: most species occupy distinct clusters in cranial morphospace that closely correspond to the main caecilian clades, and each cluster is separated by unoccupied morphospace. The empty spaces in shape space are unlikely to be caused entirely by extinction or incomplete sampling. The main caecilian clades have different amounts of morphological disparity, but neither clade age nor number of species account for this variation. Cranial shape variation is clearly linked to phyletic divergence, but there is also homoplasy, which is attributed to extrinsic factors associated with head-first digging: features of caecilian crania that have been previously argued to correlate with differential microhabitat use and burrowing ability, such as subterminal and terminal mouths, degree of temporal fenestration (stegokrotaphy/zygokrotaphy), and eyes covered by bone, have evolved and many combinations occur in modern species. We find evidence of morphological convergence in cranial shape, among species that have eyes covered by bone, resulting in a narrow bullet-shaped head. These results reveal a complex history, including early expansion of morphospace and both divergent and convergent evolution resulting in the diversity we observe today. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","source":"Scopus","title":"Evolution of Cranial Shape in Caecilians (Amphibia: Gymnophiona)","funding text 1":"Acknowledgments We thank R.

The present study analyses the permanent dentition of Basketmaker II and Mimbres individuals from multiple sites using the Arizona State University dental anthropology system, and compares them with a regional sample. Discrete dental trait analysis provides a useful means for assessing the degree of genetic relatedness between populations when large comparative samples are available. Both in situ cultural change and population replacement have been posited as the dominant mechanism acting on Basketmaker and early Puebloan groups. We examine the relationship of these populations to probable Uto-Aztecan speakers in light of the Uto-Aztecan farmer migration hypothesis. The Basketmaker II complex, traditionally recognised as a distinct cultural unit, exhibits considerable population heterogeneity. Western Basketmakers appear to share biological ties with Uto-Aztecan speakers, while Eastern Basketmakers do not, as predicted by the model. The relationship of the Mimbres to probable Uto-Aztecan speakers is less clear because the Mimbres show only weak affinities to northern Mexican populations.

As part of economic relief intended to mitigate the economic collapse of the early 1930s under the weight of the Dust Bowl droughts and the Great Depression, sites had been identified and tested in 12 counties. Beginning in 1933, the bulk of the archaeology had taken place at sites in the Arkansas River drainage system, culminating most notably in the cleanup of the regrettable looting and destruction of the Craig Mound at Spiro. As federal funds continued to be poured into work relief programs, field crews moved to nearby Mississippian mounds and villages and a series of Late Archaic and Woodland midden mounds along Fourche Maline Creek. In May 1941, University of Oklahoma archaeologist David Baerreis started operations in McCurtain County in the southeast corner of Oklahoma. For the next nine months, Baerreis directed excavations at two prehistoric Caddo sites along the Glover River, the mound center at Clement (34MC8-10) and what was presumed until recently to be the much smaller McDonald site (34MC11/12). The excavations came to a halt in early 1942 when the United States entered World War II and the Great Depression ended. Federal funds were shifted to the war effort, and workers, including Baerreis himself, were sent overseas (Rogers 1978). © 2013 by The University of Alabama Press.

A sequence of projectile point types was established according to their changes in size and shape. These stone tools, along with others cultural evidences, sensed to differentiate a series of \"cultural periods,\" which were, for decades, the frame of reference to understand the cultural evolution in southernmost Patagonia. Although later researches have questioned several of these assumptions, the classical typology of projectile points continued in use until the present day. The goal of this work is to evaluate size and shape variation in two late Holocene projectile point types, known as Fell. Bird, or Magallanes IV and V points or Patagónicas and Ona points, respectively. These two types are compared using geometric morphometries and multivariate statistical analyses. The reliability in the discrimination between types is tested at the light of reduction. The analyses have shown a major incidence of reduction on shape rather than on size, and on blade rather than on stem. However, in average, types IV and V can be distinguished in terms of size, and stem shape despite reduction. Thus, even though successive cycles of use, damage and resharpening have a great influence over size and shape of projectile points, resharpening techniques are specific enough to maintain the differences of size and shape between types, a pattern that is probably related with functional requirements.

The absence of agriculture in much of prehistoric Texas versus the widespread adoption offarming in Mesoamerica is explored utilizing a theory of intensification recently proposed by Binford in Constructing Frames of Reference. Availability of either aquatic or high quality wild plant resources are expected to delay intensification on plants which might lead to agriculture. Hunter-gatherer population models suggest where intensification processes may occur early in prehistoric sequences. These models are compared with archaeological stable isotope and burned rock midden data from Texas which indicate hunter-gatherers on the Texas coastal plain made substantial use of aquatic resources and that burned rock middens likely reflect intensified use of wild plants. The temporal and spatial distribution of these strategies is consistent with the expectations of the models.

Consisting of 18 earthen mounds and numerous additional habitation areas dating to A.D. 1250-1550, the Bottle Creek site was first professionally investigated in 1932 when David L. DeJarnette of the Alabama Museum of Natural History began work there to determine if the site had a cultural relationship with Moundville, connected to the north by a river system. Although partially mapped in the 1880s, Bottle Creek\u0027s location in the vast Mobile-Tensaw Delta of Baldwin County completely surrounded by swamp made it inaccessible and protected it from most of the plunder experienced by similar sites in the Southeast. This volume builds on earlier investigations to present extensive recent data from major excavations conducted from 1991 to 1994 and supported in part by an NEH grant. Ten anthropologists examine various aspects of the site, including mound architecture, prehistoric diet, pottery classification, vessel forms, textiles used to make pottery impressions, a microlithic stone tool industry, water travel, the persistence of mound use into historic times, and the position of Bottle Creek in the protohistoric world. The site is concluded to be the best remaining example of Pensacola culture, an archaeological variant of the widespread Mississippian tradition identified by a shell-tempered pottery complex and by its geographic association with the north-central coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Occupied for three centuries by a thriving native culture, Bottle Creek is an important remnant of North American peoples and as such is designated a National Historic Landmark. This published compilation of the research data should establish a base for future scholarly investigation and interpretation. Ian W.

Shorter records provide similar information in many archaeological contexts. However if such records are to be used to provide precise timing of events, and more critically the relative timing between different records, methods are needed to provide accurate and precise age-depth models for these sequences. Given the imprecision of individual calibrated radiocarbon determinations it is necessary to use the information we have about the deposition process to refine our chronologies and also to provide interpolation between dated levels in any sequence. Even with layer counted chronologies, the uncertainties are sometimes hard to quantify. This paper outlines a range of Bayesian models for deposition which have been implemented in the computer programme OxCal. These models can be used to combine information from the sediments themselves with radiocarbon or other direct dating information. Such models have the potential to integrate information between different records and provide a coherent chronology on which to base environmental or archaeological research. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

They exhibit low frequencies of the metaconule and lower premolar multiple lingual cusps and moderate frequencies of the canine tubercle, Carabelli\u0027s trait, cusp 7, and lower second molars with four cusps and X groove patterns. When Pima crown trait frequencies were compared to those of 13 Southwest Indian samples, their closest affinities were to other Uto‐Aztecan groups, the Papago and Hopi. The Pima are most divergent from Athapaskans and are also clearly removed from Yuman speaking groups and the Zuni.

While these two populations consumed comparable amounts of maize and protein, differences in the isotopic signature of the protein component of the diet suggests variation in the source of protein between these two sites. Sex differences in diet were identified within the ESLSQ sample, suggesting males in this sample consumed a C4-enriched protein source not regularly consumed by ESLSQ females.

In contrast, plots of Δ13Ccollagen against Δ13C apatite provide a model of three regression lines (C3, C4, and marine diet protein) where position on each line indicates the energy source (C3, C4, or mixed). Neither body size nor trophic position appears to affect these relationships. Modern free-ranging, terrestrial fauna do not fit the model perhaps because they, unlike the experimental fauna, mainly use fermentation rather than digestion during energy metabolism. Archaeological humans fall as expected based on associated floral and faunal evidence. Foraging people plot at positions expected from associated C3 fauna and plants. Those from Cahokia plot, as expected, from associated deer, nuts, and maize whereas people from nearby smaller sites plot in positions consistent with eating more fish. Agriculturists from Ontario and Grasshopper Pueblo plot consistent with dependence on fish by the former and on turkeys by the latter. In Tierra del Fuego, people from interior regions ate more terrestrial fauna, as suggested by ethnohistoric reports, than did people from the coast.

Dental specimens are compared from seven sites in Mississippi and one in Alabama ranging in time from the Archaic to the Protohistoric periods. Microwear analysis of phase II dental facets is performed and pit percentages, scratch length and width, and pit length and width are recorded. Analysis of variance statistical tests were performed between temporally contiguous sites. The results indicate that the size and frequency of microwear features decrease through time until the Protohistoric period where pit feature size and frequencies increase significantly. These results are then compared to stable isotope analysis to test whether the methods yield congruent results and to assess additional dietary changes, specifically the increased importance of nut foods. Carbon isotope analysis indicates differences in dietary maize use between the Mississippian and Protohistoric samples and dental microwear analysis show a significant increase in pit percentages and pit size, microwear features generally associated with hard food mastication. One important question addressed is whether there was a return in the Protohistoric period to naturally available resources, specifically hard foods such as nuts, a pattern observed at sites in Alabama and Arkansas. The use of secondary burials in the later Protohistoric period is examined as a possible cause for this microwear pattern. The study demonstrates the importance of integrating different methods when assessing dietary change, especially when ethnobotanical information is not available. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This three-dimensional technique is compared with conventional two-dimensional methods to investigate which methods capture morphological variation in the assemblage most comprehensively. Additionally, a set of experimentally produced bifacial tools are incorporated into the analyses to isolate the behavioral pattern underpinning identified variation in the archaeological assemblage. The interpretative breadth of current models explaining morphological variation in bifacial tools is then tested against the pattern identified in the Elandsfontein assemblage. Variation appears to be related to the consistent application of a specific reduction strategy associated with the early stages of bifacial tool manufacture. The intensity with which this strategy was applied seems to have been mediated by the availability of raw material that was suitable for the production of large bifacial tools. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Pyrolysis-GC/MS, which provides structural information on complex mixtures of organic matter, was applied to the NaOH-extractable organic matter of an acidic colluvial soil (Atlantic ranker) sampled with high resolution (5 cm) that harbours a fire record of at least 8.5 ka. Additionally, 5 charcoal samples from selected soil layers were characterised using pyrolysis-GC/MS for comparison. Pyrolysis-GC/MS allowed distinguishing between BC and non-charred organic matter. It is argued that a large proportion of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzenes and benzonitrile in the pyrolysates of the extractable organic matter, together accounting for 21-54% of total identified peak area, derived from BC. In charcoal samples, these compounds accounted for 60-98% of the pyrolysis products. The large quantity of BC in almost all samples suggested a key role of fire in Holocene soil evolution. The high C content of the soil (up to 136 g C kg-1 soil) may be attributed to the presence of recalcitrant organic C as BC, in addition to the sorptive preservation processes traditionally held responsible for long-term C storage in acid soils. Interactions between reactive Al hydroxides and BC could explain the longevity of BC in the soil.

In this chapter, I argue that, far from confounding issues of variability, resharpening can be used as a classificatory principle because it reflects human technical choices related to repeated uses of a tool. The advantage that resharpening offers is that of a mathematically suitable study object, through the investigation of shape change along the continuum of size reduction. Building upon a rich history of research in both biology and prehistoric archaeology, I present a variant of a new method for comparing resharpening trajectories, using elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) and principal components analysis to compare the slopes of allometric regressions.

PyC is mainly produced as solid charred residues, including visually-defined charcoal, and a black carbon (BC) fraction chemically defined by its resistance to laboratory oxidation, plus much lower proportions of volatile soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All PyC is characterized by fused aromatic rings, but varying in cluster sizes, and presence of other elements (N, O) and functional groups. The range of PyC structures is often described as a continuum from partially charred plant materials, to charcoal, soot and ultimately graphite which is formed by the combination of heat and pressure. There are several reasons for current interest in defining more precisely the role of PyC in the C cycle of boreal regions. First, PyC is largely resistant to decomposition, and therefore contributes to very stable C pools in soils and sediments. Second, it influences soil processes, mainly through its sorption properties and cation exchange capacity, and third, soot aerosols absorb solar radiation and may contribute to global warming. However, there are large gaps in the basic information needed to address these topics. While charcoal is commonly defined by visual criteria, analytical methods for BC are mainly based on various measures of oxidation resistance, or on yield of benzenepolycarboxylic acids. These methods are still being developed, and capture different fractions of the PyC structural continuum. There are few quantitative reports of PyC production and stocks in boreal forests (essentially none for boreal peatlands), and results are difficult to compare due to varying experimental goals and methods, as well as inconsistent terminology. There are almost no direct field measurements of BC aerosol production from boreal wildfires, and little direct information on rates and mechanisms for PyC loss. Structural characterization of charred biomass and forest floor from wildfires generally indicates a low level of thermal alteration, with the bulk of the material having H/C ratios still \u0026gt;0.2, and small aromatic cluster sizes. Especially for the more oxidation-resistant BC fraction, a variety of mainly circumstantial evidence suggests very slow decomposition, with turnover on a millennial timescale (in the order of 5-7 ky), also dependent on environmental conditions. However, there is also evidence that some PyC may be lost in only tens to hundreds of years due to a combination of lower thermal alteration and environmental protection. The potential for long-term PyC storage in soil may also be limited by its consumption by subsequent fires. Degraded, functionalized PyC is also incorporated into humified soil organic matter, and is transported eventually to marine sediments in dissolved and particulate form. Boreal production is estimated as 7-17 TgBCy-1 of solid residues and 2-2.5 TgBCy-1 as aerosols, compared to global estimates of 40-240 and 10-30TgBCy-1, respectively. Primary research needs include basic field data on PyC production and stocks in boreal forests and peatlands, suitable to support C budget modeling, and development of standardized analytical methods and of improved approaches to assess the chemical recalcitrance of typical chars from boreal wildfires. To accomplish these goals effectively will require much greater emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation.","source":"Scopus","title":"Black (pyrogenic) carbon: A synthesis of current knowledge and uncertainties with special consideration of boreal regions","volume":"3","page start":"397","author(s) id":"56713637300;8741841600;","index keywords":"biomass; black carbon; boreal forest; carbon cycle; carbon monoxide; charcoal; fire; global warming; PAH; sediment; shoot; soil","document type":"Article","cited by":"431","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Preston C.M., Schmidt M.W.I.","doi":"10.5194/bg-3-397-2006"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Perttula T.K.","x":105.19184112548828,"y":176.89649963378906,"id":"1417","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79951872389","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2010","page end":"235","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-79951872389\u0026doi\u003d10.1179%2fsea.2010.29.2.001\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d70aead5281498a0d04a8283e889da46a","source title":"Southeastern Archaeology","abstract":"Geophysical investigations on archaeological sites in the Caddo area of the Southeastern United States have become in recent years a critical part of the investigation of prehistoric and early historic Caddo sites, from small farmsteads and hamlets to large mound centers.

Mounting evidence suggests that prehistoric human activities may have interfered with natural pedogenesis on a large scale. Therefore, we undertook to identify parameters that would enable researchers to infer a human interference with pedogenesis. We selected a soil with a known history of prehistoric influence (Seeben), later referred to as ancient soil, and a reference soil (Zöberitz) with properties representative of the chernozemic soils in the vicinity. We did a survey of parameters that are commonly used to characterize pedogenetic dynamics and combined this with an investigation of organic matter properties. We found that prehistoric land use has predominantly modified the properties of the subsoil, rendering it unlikely that such modifications are the result of either (i) contemporary agricultural management or (ii) natural input dynamics via root systems or bioturbation. Soil color was darker, bulk density higher, and C/N ratio wider in the ancient soil. The mineral matrix was uniform down to a depth of 95 cm in the ancient soil, whereas a B-horizon with a corresponding change in clay mineral assemblage was developed in the reference soil. Compared with the reference soil, the carbon stock was elevated by a factor of 2.5 in the ancient soil, with more carbon associated with the clay fraction. We identified large contributions of charred organic matter in the ancient soil by two independent methods (Benzene polycarboxylic acid BPCA; Transmission electron microscopy, TEM), and confirmed by means of solid-state cross-polarization/magic angle spinning/nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-CP-MAS-NMR) spectroscopy that organic matter aromaticity was higher in the ancient soil. We suggest that any simultaneous occurrence of several of the observations listed above should be regarded as a strong indication for human interference with soil genesis.","source":"Scopus","title":"Prehistoric alteration of soil properties in a Central German chernozemic soil: In search of pedologic indicators for prehistoric activity","volume":"168","page start":"292","author(s) id":"57203196175;6701473266;7005530394;7103024868;7004410125;7102002086;","index keywords":"anthropogenic effect; Chernozem; land use; pedogenesis; prehistoric; soil carbon; Germany","document type":"Article","cited by":"32","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Benzenecarboxylic acids; Charred organic carbon; Pedogenesis; Prehistoric land use; Solid state 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; X-ray diffraction","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Kleber M., Rößner J., Chenu C., Glaser B., Knicker H., Jahn R.","doi":"10.1097/00010694-200304000-00006"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Meneton P., Jeunemaitre X., De Wardener H.E., Macgregor G.A.","x":608.6060180664062,"y":-2179.90283203125,"id":"512","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-15544364940","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2005","page end":"715","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-15544364940\u0026doi\u003d10.1152%2fphysrev.00056.2003\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d1374d74a2e00dcac99b2d8240fceb0bb","source title":"Physiological Reviews","abstract":"Epidemiological, migration, intervention, and genetic studies in humans and animals provide very strong evidence of a sausal link between high salt intake and high blood pressure.

From an evolutionary viewpoint, the human species is adapted to ingest and excrete \u003c1 g of salt per day, at least 10 times less than the average values currently observed in industrialized and urbanized countries. Independent of the rise in blood pressure, dietary salt also increases cardiac left ventricular mass, arterial thickness and stiffness, the incidence of strokes, and the severity of cardiac failure.

This section is underlain by geological deposits from the Cretaceous period, in contrast to the Tertiary-period deposits that underlie the rest of the West Gulf Coastal Plain of southern Arkansas, with which it nonetheless shares many characteristics. An important difference is that the geological substrate of southwestern Arkansas sometimes includes calcareous materials such as limestone, chalk, and marl. Areas within southwestern Arkansas underlain by these deposits are here referred to as the blackland prairie region. This term does not denote one contiguous area, but rather several discrete areas shown on the General Soil Map of Arkansas as blackland prairie or Oktibbeha-Sumter soil association (USDA Soil Conservation Service 1982; Figure 7.1). Within these areas, calcareous soils supporting blackland prairies and related communities are interspersed with areas of acidic soils covered with pine-hardwood forests like those of the rest of the coastal plain. Roberts (1979) estimated the total area of the blackland prairie region of southwestern Arkansas at about 130,000 ha. Although the landscape is generally made up of rolling hills, slopes of over 50 percent gradient occur, along with at least one nearly vertical cliff (White Cliffs in Little River County). Severe erosion is common, with gullies up to 10 m deep. Level areas are characterized by black soils with high levels of organic matter that give the region its name, but soils abused by poor management practices (such as overgrazing land) and other eroded soils over chalk are olive to white in color. The presence of calcareous geologic materials has had profound effects on the vegetation, soil, and land use of the region. A distinctive landcover type, the blackland prairie, and related savanna, woodland, and forest communities occurred on these calcareous substrates. Owing to a lack of systematic inventories, descriptions, and studies, however, the nature of these communities has been poorly understood. As recently as 1974, no contemporary examples were recognized (Foti 1974). As used here, a prairie is an area dominated by characteristic herbaceous plants (typically over a hundred species). Blackland prairies are those that occur on these distinctive calcareous substrates; they differ in both dominant vegetation and characteristic species from other tallgrass prairies of the Midwest and Midsouth. On calcareous soils within the blackland prairie region of southwestern Arkansas, four prairie communities, six woodland communities, and two forest communities were defined by Hattenbach et al. (2000). The dominant grasses include little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and gamma grass (Tripsacum dactyloides) on moister areas. Compassplant (Sil- phium laciniatum) and prairie clover (Dalea purpurea) are typical forbs. These prairies usually occur on shallow soils over chalk ridges or marl (calcareous clay) slopes, often on the steep faces of asymmetrical ridges known as cuestas, which have a shallow slope and a steep slope. On the steep slopes are chalk or marl outcrops mantled with only a thin layer of soil that may be black but is more commonly olive. According to the original land-survey notes, it appears that the prairies occurred primarily on the steep slopes but extended for a distance onto the gentle slopes at the foot of the ridge. However, they were usually replaced by forest within a short distance of the toes of the slopes (Figure 7.2). Woodlands have few enough trees that herbaceous prairie vegetation dominates the ground level (typically 25-60 percent tree cover). Savannas are mostly prairie but with scattered trees. Trees of savannas and woodlands include chinkquapin oak (Quercus muhlenbergii), bois d\u0027arc (Maclura pomifera), eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and nutmeg hickory (Carya myristicaeformis). Interestingly, field notes from both the first land survey and current research show that pecan (Carya illinoensis) makes up about 10 percent of the trees within savannas and woodlands in the blackland prairie region. In other regions it is usually associated with sandy riverfronts along large rivers, in contrast to the calcareous clays of the blackland prairies. Eroded spots are common; in some places, bedrock exposures become extensive enough to form chalk glades. Although similar to a prairie or woodland, a glade occurs on rocky substrates of chalk, limestone, and gravel with thin ground cover and bare rock visible. The thin ground cover of glades includes ground plum (Astragalus crassicarpus) and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula). In such areas with very thin soil, the original community developed as woodland dominated by Ashe\u0027s juniper (J. asheii) and Durand\u0027s oak (Quercus sinuata). A major problem in understanding the original character of southwestern Arkansas is that the area has been subjected to extensive and intensive land uses including row-crop agriculture, grazing, forestry, mining, and urbanization for almost two centuries. These changes have so modified the landscape that it is virtually impossible to find undisturbed areas; consequently, it is difficult to reconstruct the original character of the landscape without the use of historical resources such as those cited in this study. Archaeological studies can provide insight into areas of the landscape that were substantially modified well before historical descriptions were written. Moreover, as the area has been the subject of few ecological studies, there is little baseline information on the character and distribution of natural communities. Because of the dearth of ecological information from southwestern Arkansas, the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission (ANHC) determined in 1985 to increase its efforts within this region. The work began with comprehensive surveys to locate least-disturbed areas. Data on those areas as well as from the scientific literature and historical sources were then used to develop a better understanding of the natural systems of the region, and eventually to preserve representative examples of the region\u0027s natural diversity. The purposes of this paper are to synthesize and update 15 years of inventory and study and to present an overview of the historical distribution and character, as well as the present status, potential, and plans for protection and restoration, of natural landscapes of the blackland prairie region of southwestern Arkansas.

Spectroscopic analysis (solid char and Py-WSOM) with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) indicated that the Py-WSOM extracted from two low temperature chars (one wood, one grass) was dominated by polar moieties (-OH and C-O) derived from depolymerization and fragmentation of lignocellulose. Incubation experiments under aerobic conditions with unsterilized river water suggested that Py-WSOM and associated biomarkers may have a turnover rate of the order of weeks to months, consistent with mixing and transport conditions of riverine systems. For example, pyrogenic dissolved organic carbon (Py-DOC) had a half-life of 30-40. days. Turnover rate for the combustion biomarkers was shorter, with levoglucosan and free lignin phenols having a half life around 3-4. days and polymeric lignin components 13-14. days. The latter observations contradict earlier studies of the biodegradation of dissolved lignin and point to the need for re-assessment of lignin degradation kinetics in well-mixed riverine systems, particularly when such lignin components are derived from thermally altered plant material that may exist in a form more labile than that in highly processed riverine DOM. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Characterization and biodegradation of water-soluble biomarkers and organic carbon extracted from low temperature chars","funding text 1":"We thank S.

Archaeology","abstract":"Although Caddo pottery is most recognized for its nonrepresentative decorative patterns, artists also incorporated zoomorphic figurai components into their designs. Amphibian and reptilian depictions occur not only on pottery vessels but also on pipes, figurines, and pendants. Five modes of depiction occurred in the Caddo archaeological area, spanning the period from ca. A.D. 1100 to 1700. These depictions represent local expressions of the Beneath World creatures that were recognized by people across the Eastern Woodlands. These expressions embodied the power of the Beneath World and played a role in mediating with that power in regards to agriculture, travel, death, and political processes. The Caddo people integrated these zoomorphic representations into their distinctive tradition of pottery design, creating a unique cultural expression of a broader cosmological theme that was present throughout the Mississivvian tradition.","source":"Scopus","title":"Amphibian and reptilian imagery in Caddo art","volume":"30","page start":"79","author(s) id":"56847219000;","index keywords":"amphibian; archaeology; art; reptile; Amphibia; Reptilia","document type":"Article","root":"true","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","pr_domain":"0.0","authors":"Dowd E.L."},"color":"rgb(102,0,9)","size":32.34013366699219},{"label":"Early A.M.","x":-832.7964477539062,"y":233.87611389160156,"id":"636","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84883260401","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1982","page end":"232","source title":"Arkansas Archeology in Review","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Caddoan settlement systems in the ouachita river valley","page start":"198","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Early A.M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Bohannon C.F.","x":188.0120391845703,"y":-465.64031982421875,"id":"1461","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649283439","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1973","source title":"Research Series","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Excavations at the Mineral Springs Site, Howard County, Arkansas","volume":"5","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","authors":"Bohannon C.F."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Cohen-Ofri I., Weiner L., Boaretto E., Mintz G., Weiner S.","x":-1688.11865234375,"y":2326.138427734375,"id":"292","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-31444449590","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"3","year":"2006","page end":"439","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-31444449590\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2005.08.008\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d830dfe27484e203615fa48264619f36a","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"The structures and compositions of modern and fossil charcoal samples were compared in order to evaluate charcoal degradation processes in archaeological sites. Modern charcoal samples produced in campfires contain two major phases: graphite-like microcrystallites and a non-organized phase. These phases create a mosaic-like structure with differing relative proportions depending on the taxonomic source of the wood used. Fossil charcoal samples (Tel Dor, Israel: 3000 years BP and Kebara Cave, Israel: 40,000 years BP) also contained the graphite-like microcrystallites and the non-organized phases, but were clearly altered compared to modern charcoal. The graphite-like phase of the fossil charcoal has much higher electrical resistivity, and its ESR properties show that it has markedly altered surface electronic states. Infrared spectra show the presence of additional carboxylate groups. Oxidation has therefore altered the structure. This appears to be a \"self-humification\" process that affects the graphitic component, and probably the non-organized phase as well. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It is shown through a series of case studies from two regions in North America that archaeo-geophysical surveys can produce primary information suitable for the study of site content, structure and organization, for examining spatial patterns and relationships, and for directly confronting specific questions about a site and the past. Because large buried cultural landscapes can now be revealed, it is argued that an alternative perspective on regional or landscape archaeology may be possible because space can be viewed in terms of tens of hectares as opposed to the lens of square meters typical of archaeological excavations. Moreover, by placing focus on such buried features as dwellings, storage facilities, public structures, middens, fortifications, trails, or garden spaces that are not commonly revealed through most contemporary surface inspection methods, a richer view of archaeology, the past, and cultural landscapes can be achieved. Archaeo-geophysical suneys can also play an important role in Cultural Resource Management (CRM) contexts as feature discovery tools for focusing expensive excavations, thereby reducing the amount needed and lowering costs. Their utility is weighed against shovel test pits as a primitive and costly form of prospecting. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeoli.","source":"Scopus","title":"Geophysical surveys as landscape archaeology","volume":"68","page start":"435","author(s) id":"15019334000;","document type":"Article","cited by":"125","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"4.0","pr_domain":"0.00796812749003984","authors":"Kvamme K.L.","doi":"10.2307/3557103"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":-116.55819702148438,"y":441.1651916503906,"id":"980","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79951891343","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2007","page end":"81","source title":"Journal of Northeast Texas Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"One attempt at defining allen phase ceramic subclusters","volume":"26","page start":"77","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Barceló J.A.","x":417.2651062011719,"y":1517.1302490234375,"id":"243","attributes":{"funding details":"Generalitat de Catalunya\n\nMinisterio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n, MICINN","eid":"2-s2.0-84945304030","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2010","page end":"156","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84945304030\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2f978-3-540-95853-6_5\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dbc8886a89e3483e0f97611abf1db9bb0","source title":"Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences","abstract":"Archaeology is a quintessentially “visual” discipline, because visual perception makes us aware of fundamental properties of objects and allows us to discover how objects were produced and used in the past.

Power analysis, although generally not employed by biological anthropologists, is especially useful in interpreting statistical tests in which the null hypothesis is not rejected, and in determining appropriate sample sizes. In this report, the utility of statistical power analysis and the level of variation in power is illustrated by performing power analysis on paleopathology data (Cohen and Armelagos: Paleopathology at the Origins of Agriculture, 1984). The power analyses indicate that most samples are adequately large for detecting large differences among groups, but are inadequate for detecting small differences. Statistical analyses with inadequate power to detect small to medium effects may be of questionable utility in many areas of biological anthropology, as well as in paleopathology. The application of power analysis is recommended for determining necessary sample size in advance of data collection and for interpreting negative results.

For diagnosis of substance dependence (addiction), DSM-IV-TR has determined seven criteria, and fulfilling at least tree of them signifies addiction. When studied salt intake according to these criteria it is seen that most of them are fulfilled, showing that sodium chloride, which is not classified under the psychoactive drugs, is capable of producing addiction. Namely: at the beginning of salt abstinence, anorexia and slight nausea during meal time (withdrawal symptoms); about 1000-fold difference of per capita salt consumption between several human societies, and life-long continuation of discretional salt intake behaviour (high dose and very long duration of use); difficulty of restriction of salt intake (unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control); lack of success of salt restriction campaigns in hypertensive patients (substance use despite health problem). Additionally, the decrease of salt preferences of individuals whose salt intake are restricted for some time, and vice versa, signifies tolerance. On the other hand, it is evident that as the main culprit of developing systemic hypertension and as producing or promoting some other important health problems, salt intake causes millions of deaths in the world yearly. The recognition of addicting property of salt will facilitate combating these health problems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The compilation was developed to perceive patterns of population expansion and to plot early sites in their temporal and geographic order. The use of radiocarbon dates as data, criteria for inclusion in the compilation, the statistical processing methods used, and effects of controlling for precision and accuracy are described. The results indicate three earliest mean ages with great distance from each other in North and South America by 12,000 B. P., slightly later mean ages in Alaska, and the abrupt occurrence of Fluted and Fishtail Point sites at the beginning of the Younger Dryas climatic reversal (YD). One interpretation of these data is that there were different colonizing groups settling into different parts of the hemisphere in near-contemporaneity. Another is that Fluted and Fishtail Point sites may represent population relocations due to YD related ecological disturbances at the shorelines of those times. Corollary to the conclusions of early population diversity is the possibility of landfalls of people from areas other than Beringia in the late Pleistocene.

Most of this change has been due to the development and adoption of methods to analyze the Cartesian coordinates of anatomical landmarks. These geometric morphometric (GM) methods focus on the retention of geometric information throughout a study and provide efficient, statistically powerful analyses that can readily relate abstract, multivariate results to the physical structure of the original specimens. Physical anthropology has played a central role in both the development and the early adoption of these methods, just as it has done in the realm of general statistics, where it has served as a major motivating and contributing force behind much innovation. This review surveys the current state of GM, the role of authropologists in its development, recent applications of GM in physical anthropology, and GM-based methods newly introduced to, or by, anthropology, which are likely to impact future research.

We use both IntCal04 and IntCal09 to simulate and calibrate sequences of radiocarbon dates that represent evenly spaced calendar ages from 12,000 to 9000 BC and use IntCal09 to simulate two different demographic processes across this interval. The shapes of the calibrated summed probability distribution from our first set of simulations mirror many trends that have been interpreted in demographic terms and this shape shows clear links to the shape of the radiocarbon calibration curve.

The shapes of the calibrated summed probability distribution from our second set of simulations differ somewhat but show virtually identical trends at points where the actual frequencies of calendar dates are very different.

Under these conditions, the profile breaks down into a series of narrow matching bands separated by the spinning speed, and it becomes difficult to establish and maintain an efficient matching condition. Variable-amplitude CP (VACP), as introduced previously (Peersen et al., J. Magn. Reson. A104, 334, 1993), has been proven to be effective for restoring flat profiles at high spinning speeds. Here, a refined implementation of VACP using a ramped-amplitude cross-polarization sequence (RAMP-CP) is described. The order of the amplitude modulation is shown to be of importance for the cross-polarization process. The new pulse sequence with a linear amplitude ramp is not only easier to set up but also improves the performance of the variable-amplitude experiment in that it produces flat profiles over a wider range of matching conditions even with short total contact times.

The phenotypic evolution of a lineage is defined as a trajectory across a set of evolutionary levels in a multivariate phenotype space. Attributes of these trajectories (their size, direction, and shape), are quantified, and statistically compared across pairs of taxa, and a summary statistic is used to determine the extent to which patterns of phenotypic evolution are concordant across multiple taxa. This approach provides a direct quantitative description of how patterns of phenotypic evolution differ, as well as a statistical assessment of the degree of repeatability in the evolutionary responses to selection among taxa. We describe how this approach can quantify phenotypic trajectories from many ecological and evolutionary processes, whose data encode multivariate characterizations of the phenotype, including: phenotypic plasticity, ecological selection, ontogeny and growth, local adaptation, and biomechanics.

Various pits and a ditch found in the area are distinct from the surrounding loamy soil because of the dark brown color of their filling materials. Although several artifacts have been discovered, at the present stage of research neither the nature of the filling material nor the function of pits and the ditch are well understood. Thus, the organic matter composition of 30 filling layers from 11 Neolithic pits found in this settlement was investigated and compared with that of a nearby Luvisol profile and two A horizons from contemporary Phaeozems. All samples were subjected to C and N analysis, soil lightness measurements, solid-state 13C CPMAS nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and polysaccharide and lignin analysis. The organic carbon contents are higher in the Neolithic samples than in the Luvisol horizons, but they are generally lower than in the A horizons of contemporary phaeozemic soils developed from loess. The Neolithic samples have a much higher intensity in darkness than do the surrounding Luvisol horizons. The organic carbon content of the Neolithic samples correlates with the lightness value. Solid-state 13C NMR measurements revealed that this correlation is primarily because of their aromatic C content, which is considerably higher in the Neolithic samples than in the contemporary soils. Small polysaccharide amounts and no lignin-derived phenols were found in the Neolithic samples. Thus, the organic material filling the Neolithic pits is significantly different in overall chemical composition from the surrounding soil. It represents a highly altered, highly aromatic material showing no evidence of lignin degradation products and probably deriving from non-soil origins.","source":"Scopus","title":"Chemical composition of the organic matter in neolithic soil material as revealed by CPMAS 13C NMR spectroscopy, polysaccharide analysis, and CuO oxidation","volume":"166","page start":"569","author(s) id":"57196798247;7004410125;6603869394;7004944025;","index keywords":"chemical composition; fill; Neolithic; nuclear magnetic resonance; organic matter; paleosol; Germany","document type":"Article","cited by":"22","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Filling matrix; Lignin degradation products; Neolithic pits; Polysaccharide amounts; Soil color; Soil lightness measurements; Solid-state 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Schmid E.-M., Knicker H., Bäumler R., Kögel-Knabner I.","doi":"10.1097/00010694-200109000-00001"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Perttula T.K., Bruseth J.E., Kenmotsu N.A., Martin W.A.","x":472.0990905761719,"y":-197.7271728515625,"id":"1451","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84898494987","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1995","cited by":"5","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Cultural Resource Management Report No.8.

Moore reprint series that covers archaeological discoveries along North American Waterways. Clarence B. Moore (1852-1936), a wealthy Philadelphia socialite, paper company heir, and photographer, made the archaeology of the Southeast his passion. Beginning in the 1870s, Moore systematically explored prehistoric sites along the major waterways of the region, from the Ohio River south to Florida and as far west as Texas, publishing his findings, at his own expense, with the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. This volume, the final in a series of nine, includes Moore\u0027s investigations along waterways of Arkansas and Louisiana-the Ouachita, Red, Saline, Black, Tensas, and Atchafalaya Rivers-in three complete field sessions ending in 1909, 1912, and 1913. He located and mapped more than 185 mounds and cemeteries. Artifacts recovered in this territory, such as ceramic effigy pots, earthenware pipes, arrowheads, celts, and projectile points, include some of the most important ones discovered by Moore in his 47 years of excavating. Included in this volume is a CD containing the 69 color illustrations from all the original expedition volumes. The elaborate earthwork of Poverty Point, located in West Carroll Parish, Louisiana, is perhaps the most remarkable archaeological site presented in the volume. In some cases, Moore documented sites along the tributaries that have since been destroyed by river action or looters. In other cases, the National Register of Historic Sites and concerned landowners in Arkansas and Louisiana have preserved the record of aboriginal peoples and their life ways that was first illuminated by Moore\u0027s sophisticated study. © 2003 by The University of Alabama Press.

The Moundville appearances of the interregional distribution of SECC images are useful for analysis because they are part of a large local collection which has been well studied and can thus be quantified (Steponaitis 1983). An examination of the Moundville SECC imagery reveals five images that seem to be closely related - hand-and-eye, skull, bone, winged serpent, and raptor (Fig. 8.1). Of the five motifs, the winged serpent and the hand-and-eye appear most frequently. In Steponaitis\u0027s catalog they are listed thirty-three and thirty-one times, respectively. The hand-and-eye motif appears to be the connector for the cluster, appearing in connection with all of the other motifs. On twenty vessels it is found alone; on seven it appears with bones; and on two it has a skull with it. The hand-and-eye motif also appears once with a raptor head and once with a winged serpent, but the raptor is alone in its other eleven showings, and the winged serpent stands alone on its other thirty-two bottles. Finally, the skull and bone appear together on three vessels. Neither the skull nor the bone ever appears alone on the ceramics at Moundville, according to Steponaitis\u0027s listing (Steponaitis 1983). This cluster of five motifs thus is distinctive in the Moundville iconographic corpus, for it has no other associations. Each of the motifs stands alone or in association with one of the other four. They appear together, but they do not appear randomly in conjunction with the many other images of the SECC. That pattern suggests that the five images are related - hand-and-eye, skull, bones, raptor, and winged serpent belong together in a single iconographic complex. This discrete grouping of five SECC images is the focus of this chapter. Although the evidence is complicated, the argument is simple: the artistic cluster illustrates a complex of beliefs regarding the death of human beings. The mortuary belief complex in question manifests variation in ethnographic details from one tribal group to another, as might be expected, but there is a unifying metaphor which argues for a common core of belief across the Eastern Woodlands and Plains, and probably far beyond that area. That unifying notion is an understanding of the Milky Way as the path on which the souls of the deceased must walk. Demonstrating this interpretation of the iconographic cluster is a complicated problem, for it involves analyzing ethnographic notes and myth texts from a large geographical area, coupled with ethnoastronomical considerations, to produce a synthetic model of the Path of Souls belief complex.

In southern France this cereal is common in carbonized contexts such as cultural layers, ditches, pits, hearths, etc. The distinction between the two subspecies, two-rowed (. Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichum L.) and six-rowed barley (. H.vulgare subsp. vulgare L.) is usually based on morphological characters. The following criteria can be used to discriminate both subspecies from archaeological remains: the number of fertile spikelets per rachis segments, the linear or horseshoe shape depression of the lemma base, the maximum width of the caryopses and the proportion of twisted grains. The recovery of thousands of caryopses, some clearly twisted, and of rachis segments with sterile spikelets from the site of Petit Clos (Perpignan, Pyrénées-Orientales, France) dating to the Roman period suggests that both subspecies were cultivated during this time in southern Gaul. However evidence for two-rowed barley is usually scarce in archaeobotanical reports from Roman and medieval sites. To confirm the presence of two-rowed barley in the carbonized assemblage from Petit Clos and its cultivation, we developed a new method for analysing caryopses shape using geometric morphometrics with landmarks and sliding semi-landmarks. We compared modern reference specimens to the archaeological grains from several excavations from southern France dating from the 1st to the 11th century AD. Several varieties of both subspecies were correctly identified in the modern reference sample using GMM, both before and after carbonization. Archaeological specimens could then be accurately identified. The results confirm that both subspecies of barley were cultivated in southern France during the Roman period. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Geometric morphometric analysis of grain shape and the identification of two-rowed barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. distichumL.) in southern France","funding text 1":"We would like to thank Michel Lemoine (CNRS, Muséum), for his invaluable help during the carbonization of the fresh caryopses.

Two new archeological sites have provided reliable radiocarbon data and for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of northern fluted points is possible. Here, technological and morphological analyses of northern fluted points are presented, including variables statistically evaluated and compared to a collection of fluted Folsom artifacts serving as a reference. Variation in tool shape was measured using geometric morphometrics, and a new approach to landmark placement designed to characterize basal morphology and allow the analysis to include tool fragments is presented. Results confirm that northern fluted points represent a cohesive technological strategy and are used to formulate hypotheses suggesting its service as a risk-management system promoting ease-of-replacement-after-failure to offset transport costs and reduce risk during long-distance travel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","source":"Scopus","title":"The northern fluted point complex: technological and morphological evidence of adaptation and risk in the late Pleistocene-early Holocene Arctic","funding text 1":"Acknowledgments This research was funded by a National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant (Goebel and Smith, grant number 204085, Arctic Social Sciences program) and a Texas A\u0026M University Liberal Arts Dissertation Fellowship.

Smith 1995). The knowledge gained about the native American past in the region, about the challenges faced during times of prehistoric cultural change, and during the wrenching episode (still ongoing) of contact and interaction between the Caddo peoples and European and Anglo- American colonizers and settlers (Perttula 1998b) helps to make \"native history\" an integral part of-rather than a footnote to-the ongoing study of Texas\u0027 cultural heritage. While there is every reason to think that our knowledge of northeastern Texas prehistory will continue to grow by leaps and bounds, there are tremendous research and preservation challenges ahead for each prehistoric era. On a mundane level, it is important that we continually cast a critical and discerning eye at our research priorities for prehistoric and Caddoan archeological sites, the value of our methodological approaches, and the worth of our cultural resource management planning documents. From the innovative use of these tools come the new perspectives and conceptions that lead to a broader understanding of the past. Changes in research strategies are critical, but in northeastern Texas they are, unfortunately, only part of the archeological story. Of the utmost concern for the long-term protection and preservation of the region\u0027s priceless archeological heritage is dealing directly with the unabated looting and vandalism of prehistoric Caddo villages and cemeteries-on private as well as state and federal lands (Perttula and Nelson 1999). The archeological landscape is pitted and pocked with the looter\u0027s holes and backdirt piles. Many of the most important archeological sites in the region have been irretrievably damaged and destroyed, and it is questionable that the looting frenzy can be quelled even should an unmarked burial protection bill ever be made law in Texas; the situation is not much better in Arkansas, Louisiana, or Oklahoma. The cultural patrimony of the Caddo peoples is being taken from them, with almost no hand being lifted to help protect these significant cultural treasures. This challenge is our greatest in the years ahead: to find a way, in concert with the Caddo people, to protect and preserve this cultural legacy: \"In 1541 when the Spaniards arrived, every place in the Caddo country had, of course, a Caddo name but almost all of those names are gone now, like the people who bestowed them\" (Schambach 1993, 7).

Our sample consists of 38 crania: 20 modern adult Homo sapiens, 14 subadult H. sapiens, and four archaic Homo. All specimens were CT-scanned except for two infant H, sapiens, who were imaged by MR instead. For each specimen 84 landmarks and semilandmarks were located on the midsagittal plane and converted to Procrustes shape coordinates. Integration was quantified by the method of singular warps, a new geometric-statistical approach to visualizing correlations among regions. The two classic patterns of integration, evolutionary and ontogenetic, were jointly explored by comparing analyses of overlapping subsamples that span ranges of different hypothetical factors. Evolutionary integration is expressed in the subsample of 24 adult Homo, and ontogenetic integration in the subsample of 34 H. sapiens. In this data set, vault, cranial base, and face show striking and localized patterns of covariation over ontogeny, similar but not identical to the patterns seen over evolution. The principal differences between ontogeny and phylogeny pertain to the cranial base. There is also a component of cranial to height ratio not reducible to either process. Our methodology allows a separation of these independent processes (and their impact on cranial shape) that conventional methods have not found. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here, we review and synthesize a range of recent work that we have undertaken on the issue of Levallois, with the aim of further considering its implications in terms of social learning during the Palaeolithic. Specifically, our recent experimental work has provided evidence that Levallois reduction supplied flakes that have predictable benefits from a functional perspective, and also supported an hypothesis that it has benefits relating to raw material economy. Geometric morphometric analyses of archaeological cores have, meanwhile, demonstrated that examples conforming to “classic” (lineal) Levallois form have certain geometric properties that display limited variation, even across wide geographic regions. Hence, replicating this morphology consistently may have demanded specific requirements on the part of individual knappers in order to procure its potential benefits. Given these findings, it may be important to ask whether replication of “Levallois” industries involved social transmission mechanisms beyond those used by populations producing earlier forms of stone tools. Drawing on findings from the literature on social learning, we outline a series of factors that suggest this to be the case. Although independent tests of this hypothesis are required, within the context of Lower-Middle Palaeolithic industries, Levallois reduction stands out as a candidate potentially requiring active instruction (i.e., teaching) for effective cultural replication. © 2016 Taylor \u0026 Francis.","source":"Scopus","title":"Levallois: Potential Implications for Learning and Cultural Transmission Capacities","volume":"41","page start":"19","author(s) id":"9434693200;23471109300;23975681200;","document type":"Article","cited by":"11","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Knapping costs; Levallois; Social learning","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Lycett S.J., Von Cramon-Taubadel N., Eren M.I.","doi":"10.1179/2051618515Y.0000000012"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Martínez Cortizas A., Mighall T., Pontevedra Pombal X., Nóvoa Muñoz J.C., Peiteado Varela E., Piñeiro Rebolo R.","x":-1568.996826171875,"y":2051.01904296875,"id":"306","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-22644441431","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"5","year":"2005","page end":"706","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-22644441431\u0026doi\u003d10.1191%2f0959683605hl834rp\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003db97c1f9f0197f3490691232cac7be897","source title":"Holocene","abstract":"A high-resolution, 5300-yr record of pollen and lithogenic elements (K, Ca, Ti, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr) from an ombrotrophic peat bog located in northwest Spain, reveals that the variations in the fluxes of lithogenic elements supplied to the bog by atmospheric deposition were coupled to the evolution of the vegetation of the area. A strong negative correlation exists between the percentage of tree pollen and the concentration of lithogenic elements. For example, the correlation between total tree pollen and Sr concentrations is - 0.94. The main phases of decline of the deciduous forest occurred during known cultural periods (late Neolithic, the Metal Ages, the Roman Period, the Middle Ages and the Industrial period) suggesting a close link between human activities (fires and forest clearances), changes in the vegetation and soil erosion. The flux of lithogenic elements seems to have increased before a significant variation in pollen is detected, which may indicate that changes in soil erosion are reflected earlier than the changes in vegetation in the bog record. Variations in the composition of the deposited dust reflect impacts that occurred at different spatial scales, with local sources dominant in the late Neolithic, the Metal Ages and the Middle Ages, whilst regional sources are more important in the Roman period and the Industrial Revolution. During the prehistoric period, arboreal pollen percentages recovered to their former levels, suggesting that woodland regenerated following a disturbance phase, but for the last 1400 years no significant recovery took place until afforestation with pines was introduced 200 years ago.

The image takes several forms, but the U-shaped serpent with horns and peculiar wings was apparently particularly important at Moundville. In the only published inventory of Moundville ceramics, the winged serpent is the most numerous design (thirty-three examples), rivaled only by the hand-and-eye design (thirty-one examples) (Steponaitis 1983). This preponderance is confirmed by another scholar from his own studies of Moundville ceramics (V. J. Knight, Jr., personal communication, 1996). Other examples of the same design have been found in the ceramic collections in the Central Mississippi Valley near Memphis (Childs 1991; David Dye, personal communication, 1996). There are other forms of the winged serpent (and its variants) known from Spiro. The Moundville design, however, will serve as the particular focus for this study. The major argument is that the winged serpent is a well-known mythological figure from the religious worldview of the Eastern Woodlands and that the wings, rather than being a part of the essential form of the creature, are an indicator of location in the celestial realm. To lay out this argument, it will be necessary to survey the lore surrounding the horned serpent and look at the relevant ethnoastronomy, which is not well known for the Eastern Woodlands. The astronomical orientation of Pawnee mythology and ritual has long been recognized, but there are indications that other peoples of the Eastern Woodlands and Plains also encoded astronomical lore in their myths (Chamberlain 1982; Williamson and Farrer 1990). That wider distribution, however, may have been more than random occurrences of ethnoastronomical beliefs. This chapter and Chapter 8 argue that a set of astronomical beliefs encoded in myths and iconography constituted a symbolic complex which in earlier centuries was widely known in North America. Further, the cross-cultural nature of this belief complex was probably due to the fact that it was rooted in an even more widely accepted cosmology (see Chapter 2). For people who believe that the cosmos is basically a layer cake of worlds, the relation of the layers to each other becomes an important cosmological concern. Among the various Native American groups in the Eastern Woodlands and the Plains, those layers became identified with particular powers, enabling discussion of the relationships to take on mythic form with various \"persons\" interacting with each other in the various eras of mythic time. That mythic identification also permits the casting of structural principles in terms of the types of relationship in which each person participates. One of the primary mythological principles is the opposition of the forces of day and night. The diurnal opposition becomes expressed as tension between the powers of the celestial vault and the powers of the waters and caverns beneath the earth-disk. Central to this cosmology is the prior existence of the primeval water, which is separated from the Above World only by a deliberate act of creation - the earth, which is made to float upon the water. The primeval water is not a neutral backdrop for human life in this scheme, for it is the domain of many different species, both those which are recognized in modern science and those which are far more powerful - mythological creatures who rule the water world. As is customary in Native American myths, those water powers were prevalent and visible in primordial times, but even in modern times they are occasionally seen by humans - but only if they wish to be seen. \"These manitous often come upon earth and pass among the people; they are not always visible to the eyes of everybody\" (Jones 1911: 214). More frequently, only their works are seen, and their presence is simply supplied by the common worldview. When they do take visible form, they are described in different ways. In a variety of myths there are references to a giant fish, but while there are hints that this form was of considerable importance in former times, it is difficult to make much more of it now than just to acknowledge its existence. A more important image in the central Woodlands and the Plains is the Underwater Panther, and there are graphic illustrations of a panther, probably cognate with that figure, which come from at least as far back as Hopewellian times. The most widely recognized form of the underwater powers, however, is the Horned Water Serpent. It is frequently referred to as a single creature, but more careful reading through the collections indicates that the Underwater Panther/Horned Water Serpent is really understood to be a race of people, representatives of which may be encountered in any large body of water, whether seas, lakes, or rivers. Even so, there is still frequent reference to a \"master\" of the underwater powers. (See Emerson 1989 for an excellent study of this figure in relation to Cahokia.) The Indians say that this earth has four layers. The bottom layer does not look like the one we are on now. It is night there all the time. That is where the manitou is who is the boss that rules the bottom of the earth. He rules all four layers⋯ (Barnouw 1977: 41) It is this \"boss\" of the Beneath World who is the subject of this chapter. Since each of the specific labels - Underwater Panther, Horned Water Serpent - points to a particular visual form, this chapter will use the convention of \"Great Serpent\" whenever the subject is the total concept, regardless of form. This study will first sample the range of descriptive opinion about this figure, in regard both to appearance and function, then attempt to place it in a larger cos-mological context that will help interpret various expressions of this concept, both mythic and iconographic. The basic argument is threefold: (1) the Great Serpent was a universally known figure in the Eastern Woodlands for many centuries, despite its many forms; (2) the Great Serpent was located not only in the water world, but also in the celestial realm; and (3) the Great Serpent appears not only in myth, but also in graphic designs, both prehistoric and historic. © 2007 by the University of Texas Press.

Bone collagen stable isotope signatures covary with reliance on maize and intake of animal protein, facilitating useful reconstructions of past diet. Among the GSL Fremont, economic strategies vary over time with an initial increase in reliance on maize (A.D. 400-850) followed by a period of marked economic diversity (A.D 850-1150) then a return to reliance on wild foods (after A.D. 1150). During the period of greatest economic diversity, male and female diets vary significantly and male diets are correlated with status differences evidenced by grave goods. There is also a clear temporal correlation between the rapid abandonment of maize agriculture and significant moisture anomalies in regional tree-ring chronologies and pollen profiles. These results are discussed in the context of recent arguments regarding economic diversity, social complexity, and the demise of the Fremont. © 2002 by the Society for American Archaeology.","source":"Scopus","title":"Climate and diet in fremont prehistory: Economic variability and abandonment of maize agriculture in the Great Salt Lake basin","volume":"67","page start":"453","author(s) id":"8762903700;35177812100;","document type":"Article","cited by":"80","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Coltrain J.B., Leavilt S.W.","doi":"10.2307/1593822"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Goldstein M.S.","x":2517.0966796875,"y":999.6558227539062,"id":"769","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0040103342","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1948","page end":"84","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0040103342\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2fajpa.1330060111\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dac1c4e13be8597b232369e789839cfd1","source title":"American Journal of Physical Anthropology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Dentition of Indian crania from Texas","volume":"6","page start":"63","author(s) id":"35506139300;","index keywords":"American Indian; tooth; Indians, North American; Tooth","document type":"Article","cited by":"28","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Goldstein M.S.","doi":"10.1002/ajpa.1330060111"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Anderson D.G.","x":539.1578369140625,"y":200.8541717529297,"id":"1313","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0344548013","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2001","page end":"186","source title":"Archaeology of Eastern North America","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Climate and culture change in prehistoric and early historic eastern North America","volume":"29","page start":"143","cited by":"57","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.008964143426294821","authors":"Anderson D.G."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Hall G.D.","x":2366.862060546875,"y":736.021728515625,"id":"801","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-83755166774","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1995","page end":"57","source title":"Archeological Investigations at the Loma Sandia Site (41LK28): A Prehistoric Cemetery and Campsite in Live Oak County","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Descriptions and chronology of some prehistoric cemeteries in Texas","volume":"1","page start":"47","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Hall G.D."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Powell J.F.","x":2404.84033203125,"y":790.4254760742188,"id":"796","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33750397017","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1994","page end":"405","source title":"Aboriginal Life and Culture on the Upper Texas Coast: Archaeology at the Mitchell Ridge Site, 41GV66, Galveston Island","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Bioarchaeological Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains from the Mitchell Ridge Site","page start":"287","cited by":"5","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Powell J.F."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Andreae M.O., Merlet P.","x":-1804.3336181640625,"y":2283.389892578125,"id":"275","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0035693625","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"4","year":"2001","page end":"966","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0035693625\u0026doi\u003d10.1029%2f2000GB001382\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d92337c444ca032baab97619eb93130ca","source title":"Global Biogeochemical Cycles","abstract":"A large body of information on emissions from the various types of biomass burning has been accumulated over the past decade, to a large extent as a result of International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme/International Global Atmospheric Chemistry research activities.

These two groups of biomarkers are often used as unique tracers of combusted biomass inputs in diverse environmental media. However, detailed characterization of the relative proportion and signatures of these compounds in highly heterogeneous plant-derived chars are still scarce. Here we conducted a systematic study to investigate the yields of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols in 25 lab-made chars produced from different plant materials under different combustion conditions. Solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols were only observed in chars formed below 350 °C and yields were variable across different combustion temperatures. The yields of mannosan (M) and galactosan (G) decreased more rapidly than those of levoglucosan (L) under increasing combustion severity (temperature and duration), resulting in variable L/M and L/(M. +. G) ratios, two diagnostic ratios often used for identification of combustion sources (e.g. hardwoods vs. softwoods vs. grasses). Our observations thus may provide an explanation for the wide ranges of values reported in the literature for these two ratios. On the other hand, the results of this study suggest that the ratios of the major solvent-extractable lignin phenols (vanillyls (V), syringyls (S), cinnamyls (C)) provide additional source reconstruction potential despite observed variations with combustion temperature. We thus propose using a property-property plot (L/M vs. S/V) as an improved means for source characterization of biomass combustion residues. The L/M-S/V plot has shown to be effective in environmental samples (soil organic matter, atmospheric aerosols) receiving substantial inputs of biomass combustion residues. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Influence of combustion conditions on yields of solvent-extractable anhydrosugars and lignin phenols in chars: Implications for characterizations of biomass combustion residues","funding text 1":"We thank the support of Dr. T.

Rejection of the unwanted geomagnetic field and its diurnal variations is accomplished by adopting a gradient magnetometer arrangement in which only the difference signal from two magnetometers, separated by a short distance, is recorded. Nuclear resonance scalar magnetometers offer high sensitivity but have higher power requirements and therefore suffer a weight penalty relative to fluxgate types. Fluxgate magnetometers are vector sensing and their sensitivity is limited, mainly by thermally induced mechanical and electronic drift. This paper describes the development of a 1-m separation, vertical component, fluxgate magnetometer that alleviates these problems. Single and multiple array gradiometer configurations are presented, together with a description of data logging software developed to enhance survey efficiency.

Differences in the shapes and sizes of stone flakes—the most abundant remains of past behaviours for much of human evolutionary history—may be underpinned by variation in a range of different environmental and behavioural factors. Controlled flake production experiments have drawn inferences between flake platform preparation behaviours, which have thus far been approximated by linear measurements, and different aspects of overall stone flake variability (Dibble and Rezek J Archaeol Sci 36:1945–1954, 2009; Lin et al. Am Antiq 724–745, 2013; Magnani et al. J Archaeol Sci 46:37–49, 2014; Rezek et al. J Archaeol Sci 38:1346–1359, 2011). However, when the results are applied to archaeological assemblages, there remains a substantial amount of unexplained variability. It is unclear whether this disparity between explanatory models and archaeological data is a result of measurement error on certain key variables, whether traditional analyses are somehow a general limiting factor, or whether there are additional flake shape and size drivers that remain unaccounted for. To try and circumvent these issues, here, we describe a shape analysis approach to assessing stone flake variability including a newly developed three-dimensional geometric morphometric method (‘3DGM’). We use 3DGM to demonstrate that a relationship between platform and flake body governs flake shape and size variability. Contingently, we show that by using this 3DGM approach, we can use flake platform attributes to both (1) make fairly accurate stone flake size predictions and (2) make relatively detailed predictions of stone flake shape. Whether conscious or instinctive, an understanding of this geometric relationship would have been critical to past knappers effectively controlling the production of desired stone flakes. However, despite being able to holistically and accurately incorporate three-dimensional flake variance into our analyses, the behavioural drivers of this variance remain elusive. © 2017, The Author(s).","source":"Scopus","title":"A geometric morphometric relationship predicts stone flake shape and size variability","volume":"10","page start":"1991","author(s) id":"35085743300;55860417700;26647716500;48662907600;55579447400;57191361163;55597940400;23003880800;6506777264;","document type":"Article","cited by":"6","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Stone flake shape and size predictions; Three-dimensional geometric morphometrics","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Archer W., Pop C.M., Rezek Z., Schlager S., Lin S.C., Weiss M., Dogandžić T., Desta D., McPherron S.P.","doi":"10.1007/s12520-017-0517-2"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Iovita R.","x":587.49462890625,"y":2026.0362548828125,"id":"1430","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84455192786","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"2011","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84455192786\u0026doi\u003d10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0029029\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d851ce970229d089e017d89215d2cb4f1","access type":"Open Access","source title":"PLoS ONE","abstract":"Background: Recent findings suggest that the North African Middle Stone Age technocomplex known as the Aterian is both much older than previously assumed, and certainly associated with fossils exhibiting anatomically modern human morphology and behavior. The Aterian is defined by the presence of \u0027tanged\u0027 or \u0027stemmed\u0027 tools, which have been widely assumed to be among the earliest projectile weapon tips. The present study systematically investigates morphological variation in a large sample of Aterian tools to test the hypothesis that these tools were hafted and/or used as projectile weapons. Methodology/Principal Findings: Both classical morphometrics and Elliptical Fourier Analysis of tool outlines are used to show that the shape variation in the sample exhibits size-dependent patterns consistent with a reduction of the tools from the tip down, with the tang remaining intact. Additionally, the process of reduction led to increasing side-to-side asymmetries as the tools got smaller. Finally, a comparison of shape-change trajectories between Aterian tools and Late Paleolithic arrowheads from the North German site of Stellmoor reveal significant differences in terms of the amount and location of the variation. Conclusions/Significance: The patterns of size-dependent shape variation strongly support the functional hypothesis of Aterian tools as hafted knives or scrapers with alternating active edges, rather than as weapon tips. Nevertheless, the same morphological patterns are interpreted as one of the earliest evidences for a hafting modification, and for the successful combination of different raw materials (haft and stone tip) into one implement, in itself an important achievement in the evolution of hominin technologies. © 2011 Radu Iovita.","source":"Scopus","title":"Shape variation in aterian tanged tools and the origins of projectile technology: A morphometric perspective on stone tool function","volume":"6","author(s) id":"6506567945;","index keywords":"article; elliptical Fourier analysis; fossil hominin; Fourier analysis; materials; morphometrics; Paleolithic; projectile weapon; Stone Age; tool use; weapon; weight, mass and size; archeology; devices; human; Archaeology; Equipment and Supplies; Fourier Analysis; Humans","document type":"Article","cited by":"66","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"e29029","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Iovita R.","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0029029"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Jackson A.T.","x":282.70989990234375,"y":1821.998046875,"id":"269","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84899226851","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1934","page end":"57","source title":"Bull.

Although represented in only a handful of sites, the Still Bay is widespread geographically and, at certain localities, persisted over a substantial period of time. Many studies have focused on tracing the temporal range and geographic reach of the Still Bay, as well as inferring degrees of early modern human demographic connectedness from these parameters. Variation within the Still Bay, relative to the accuracy with which it can be identified, has received considerably less attention. However, demographic models based on the spread of the Still Bay in space and time hinge on the reliability with which it can be recognized in the archaeological record. Here we document patterns of bifacial point shape and size variation in some key Still Bay assemblages, and analyse these patterns using the statistical shape analysis tools of geometric morphometrics. Morphological variation appears to be geographically structured and is driven by the spatial separation between north-eastern and south-western clusters of sites. We argue that allometric variation is labile and reflects environmentally driven differences in point reduction, whereas shape differences unrelated to size more closely reflect technological and cultural fragmentation. Our results suggest that the biogeographic structure of Middle Stone Age populations was complex during the period associated with the Still Bay, and provide little support for heightened levels of cultural interconnectedness between distantly separated groups at this time. We briefly discuss the implications of our findings for tracing classic techno-traditions in the Middle Stone Age record of southern Africa, and for inferring underpinning population dynamics from these patterns. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"What is Still Bay?

Based on the two known sites of this age, the economy was oriented toward the procurement of megafauna such as elephants, camels, horses, and bison, although the earliest kills were probably individuals or pairs of animals that were trapped and slain (Bement 1986). The later Folsom and Plainview hunters had apparently perfected the jump technique of bison hunting, suggesting organizational skills consistent with group procurement strategies that centered upon migratory herd animals (Dibble 1970). The extinction of the large game herds and the onset of a trend toward aridity triggered a transition to Archaic lifeways about ninety-four hundred years ago. The people apparently exploited a broader resource base, developing a reliance on plant products, both as food and as raw material for the burgeoning fiber industry, while retaining established lithic traditions. The transition culminated in a robust adaptation that gives the outward but perhaps misleading impression of great stability for a period of some four thousand years. Rockshelters became the nucleus of the settlement pattern, showing differentiated activity areas of a domestic nature where fiber, wood, bone, and hide were worked, as was the everpresent stone. Mortuary customs included disposal of the dead in convenient vertical shaft caves regardless of age or gender. Then, about fifty-five hundred years ago, the cultural system began a series of internal adjustments, presumably in response to an increasingly arid environment. The end result was the consolidation of traits into the full-blown Archaic expression that defines the Lower Pecos as a distinct cultural entity. A model that parsimoniously explains this development was formulated by analogy to emerging complex societies documented ethnohistorically and archeologically in arid lands around the world. In this model, changes in the distribution of essential resources, most prominently potable water, triggered responses in the settlement pattern and procurement strategies leading to a disproportionate concentration of people along the major rivers. Aridity does not imply a shortage of food, especially if desert succulents increase at the expense of grasslands, but gathering and processing of thorny plant foods and small mammals requires specialized techniques and knowledge. The responsibility for food procurement, especially hunting and gathering in the uplands, would have been delegated to mobile task groups who operated from their bases on the rivers. Diversification broadened the diet to include labor-intensive processing of a wider range of foodstuffs, activities that took place in open camps and rockshelters as well. New methods of social control were mandated by the redistribution of human populations, who were in effect circumscribed by the availability of water. The inevitable tensions introduced by proximity elicited a restructuring of society that was accompanied by the intensification of ritual that was, in turn, manifested by the florescence of publicly produced mural art. A common belief system, rooted in the principles of shamanism and expressed in cave paintings, held sway over the area that is now defined as the Lower Pecos cultural region. This period of time is the apogee of the Lower Pecos cultural trajectory: the consolidation of an ethnic identity that trembled on the verge of societal complexity that was never achieved, possibly for lack of the ability to generate an adequate surplus- the necessary and sufficient condition for sedentism. Sometime around three thousand years ago, the insular Lower Pecos cultural persona relaxed, perhaps disrupted by the advent of new people with a different economic strategy and social structure. A mesic interlude permitted the grasslands of the Great Plains to expand to the Rio Grande, drawing herds of bison and their attendant hunters. Even episodic, perhaps seasonal, influxes of people bearing a fully developed cultural system of their own must have had a perceptible effect on the resident population; at present it can only be discerned in settlement patterns, tool types, and possibly art styles. The return to aridity and the retreat of the grasslands created a vacuum filled by desert-adapted people who came north across the Rio Grande from northern Mexico. Soon, the archeology of the Lower Pecos found affinities with that of central Texas, sharing in the generalized Late Archaic lithic assemblage while perfecting its fiber industry, retaining its characteristic burial customs, and keeping a balance between rockshelters and open camp site occupations. Measures of population density again rise, reaching and exceeding the heights achieved during the Middle Archaic peak, but the processes behind the increase are less clear. The Late Prehistoric period experienced a cultural upheaval, including changes in settlement patterns, site types, mortuary customs, art styles, and artifact types. Pictograph styles show affinities with northern Mexico and the Big Bend region of Texas, lithic tool types are shared with the rest of Texas, and mortuary customs appear to be introduced from the north and northwest. Clearly, people, rather than ideas, were on the move. Late in prehistory, one intrusive group is identified by a distinctive artifact assemblage, including small arrow points and ceramics, a preference for promontories with sweeping views, and residences that used paired stones as pole supports for a thatch or hide cover. The people of the Infierno phase may be precursors to ethnohistorically described bison hunters who again seasonally congregated at the mouth of the Pecos River during yet another mesic interlude. The Spanish found little of value in the Lower Pecos, isolating it as part of the great uninhabitable desert of their northern frontier, but native peoples found refuge in the rugged terrain. Indigenous groups were soon replaced by Apaches who, in turn, were driven south by the Comanches where they sometimes joined the Kickapoos, staunch allies of the Mexicans, in resisting their common enemy.

One long-held explanation for the variation in early Paleoindian point form is that prey size influenced the size and shape of projectile points. The study reported here evaluated this hypothesis with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when both point type and prey size were taken into account, the results ran counter to predictions. Potential explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Points and prey: A quantitative test of the hypothesis that prey size influences early Paleoindian projectile point form","funding text 1":"We thank Laura Nightengale, head of collections at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas at Austin, for her help in locating and photographing points from the Blackwater Draw collection.

The varying extent of these two features is assumed to largely determine the relatively high persistence of charred material in the environment and is thus of interest for, e.g., biochar characterization or carbon cycle studies. Consequently, a variety of methods has been used to assess the aromatic structure of chars, which has led to interesting insights but has complicated the comparison of data acquired with different methods. We therefore used a suite of seven methods (elemental analysis, MIR spectroscopy, NEXAFS spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, BPCA analysis, lipid analysis and helium pycnometry) and compared 13 measurements from them using a diverse sample set of 38 laboratory chars. Our results demonstrate that most of the measurements could be categorized either into those which assess aromaticity or those which assess the degree of aromatic condensation. A variety of measurements, including relatively inexpensive and simple ones, reproducibly captured the two aromatic features in question, and data from different methods could therefore be compared. Moreover, general patterns between the two aromatic features and the pyrolysis conditions were revealed, supporting reconstruction of the highest heat treatment temperature (HTT) of char. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Aromaticity and degree of aromatic condensation of char","funding text 1":"Support for M.W.I.S. was also provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231 ).

They are so fundamental that most people are completely unaware of the influence such structures exert on understanding. In some respects archaeologists, continually faced with unfamiliar objects and object parts, have proved more perspicacious than many \"hard scientists\" in these matters. \"Typology\" and \" classification\" are recurrent, if somewhat sporadic, concerns.

The majority of these points were collected from the pampas region of Argentina, Uruguay, central Chile, and southern Patagonia. These artifacts are defined by a convex blade, rounded shoulders, slightly concave stem sides, concave base, and occasional fluting on one or both faces. The presence of fluting and the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene chronological assignment have been proposed as evidence in support of a cultural relationship between these points and the early points of North America. To explore projectile point shape and related size variation in a quantitative way, we applied geometric morphometric techniques over a sample of 24 Fishtail points from Uruguay. The major trends of shape variation were tested against metric attributes, geographical provenance, and lithic raw material type. Results suggest no relationships between geographical provenance or lithic raw material type and shape variation. However, a significant correlation between size and shape was observed, which indicates an allometric relationship. Finally, we discuss some implications of these results in terms of the design and life history of projectile points and their relationship with the hunter-gatherer technology of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.

The treatments were realized at temperatures between 200 and 1000°C, with a controlled heating rate and residence time. NMR spectra were obtained in a home-built spectrometer operating at a field of 2.0 T with the use of high-resolution techniques. The results showed the steps followed during the carbonization process. Initially we observed a degradation of the natural material, with preferential loss of carbohydrates and carboxylic groups. From a heat-treatment temperature of about 500°C upward, the spectra were nearly constituted of only one resonance line with a chemical shift of about 130 ppm (from TMS), typical of aromatic structures. For the most severely treated samples, a decrease in the chemical shift of the resonance line was observed, indicating a deshielding associated with the increase in the electrical conductivity of the material. The structure of these samples was identified as consisting of planes of sp2 carbon atoms, with a chemical environment similar to graphitic materials but with no long-range spatial order. © 1999 American Chemical Society.","source":"Scopus","title":"13C high-resolution solid-state NMR study of peat carbonization","volume":"13","page start":"53","author(s) id":"7003348952;","index keywords":"Carbonization; Degradation; Electric conductivity; Heat treatment; High temperature effects; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Reaction kinetics; Chemical shift; Peat","document type":"Article","cited by":"89","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Emmerich F.G."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Wyckoff Don G., Fisher L.R.","x":771.6554565429688,"y":-186.745849609375,"id":"409","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84906655224","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1985","source title":"Archeological Resource Survey Report","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Preliminary testing and evaluation of the grobin davis site 34Mc-253, McCurtain County, Oklahoma","volume":"22","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Wyckoff Don G., Fisher L.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":570.8027954101562,"y":159.01881408691406,"id":"1339","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039184714","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"0","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.008964143426294821","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Lycett S.J.","x":573.1050415039062,"y":2142.834716796875,"id":"1419","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649190779","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"2009","page end":"92","source title":"Sourcebook of Palaeolithic Transitions: Methods, Theories, and Interpretations","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Quantifying transitions: morphometric approaches to Palaeolithic variability and technological change","page start":"79","cited by":"24","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Lycett S.J."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Wills M.A.","x":661.8275146484375,"y":1578.9110107421875,"id":"179","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0042279538","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2001","page end":"144","source title":"Fossils, Phylogeny, and Form: An Analytical Approach","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Morphological disparity: A primer","page start":"55","cited by":"61","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Wills M.A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Masiello C.A.","x":-1605.4444580078125,"y":1991.0316162109375,"id":"282","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-9644270975","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"1-4 SPEC.

Results produced in this period of expansion have been exciting: BC has been detected in many important geochemical pools, and interesting new research directions open as we learn about the role of this byproduct of biomass burning in the carbon cycle. Especially important research directions will be the quantification of BC loss processes (both biotic and abiotic), measurement of BC decomposition products in environmentally relevant reservoirs, and exploration of the interactions between BC and its host organo-mineral matrix, including the role of BC in pedogenesis. However, along with exciting results, we have also seen apparent discrepancies between BC studies. These discrepancies occur at least in part because of a lack of a common language, common methods, and a common model of BC. This paper lays out the framework many BC researchers use to understand the role of BC in the carbon cycle, discussing the \u0027combustion continuum\u0027 BC model and the methodological continuum that this model implies. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the evolution of phenotypic diversity. Both natural and sexual selection play a large role in generating phenotypic adaptations, with biomechanical requirements and developmental mechanisms mediating patterns of phenotypic evolution. For many traits, the relative importance of selective and developmental components remains understudied. Results. We investigated ontogenetic trajectories of foot morphology in the eight species of European plethodontid cave salamander to test the hypothesis that adult foot morphology was adapted for climbing. Using geometric morphometrics and other approaches, we found that developmental patterns in five species displayed little morphological change during growth (isometry), where the extensive interdigital webbing in adults was best explained as the retention of the juvenile morphological state. By contrast, three species exhibited significant allometry, with an increase in interdigital webbing during growth. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that multiple evolutionary transitions between isometry and allometry of foot webbing have occurred in this lineage. Allometric parameters of foot growth were most similar to those of a tropical species previously shown to be adapted for climbing. Finally, interspecific variation in adult foot morphology was significantly reduced as compared to variation among juveniles, indicating that ontogenetic convergence had resulted in a common adult foot morphology across species. Conclusions. The results presented here provide evidence of a complex history of phenotypic evolution in this clade. The common adult phenotype exhibited among species reveals that selection plays an important part in generating patterns of foot diversity in the group. However, developmental trajectories arriving at this common morphology are distinct; with some species displaying developmental stasis (isometry), while others show an increase in foot webbing during growth. Thus, multiple developmental solutions exist to the same evolutionary challenge. Our findings underscore the importance of examining morphological adaptations from multiple perspectives, and emphasize that both selective hypotheses and developmental processes must be considered for a more comprehensive understanding of phenotypic evolution. © 2010 Adams and Nistri; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Ontogenetic convergence and evolution of foot morphology in European cave salamanders (Family: Plethodontidae)","volume":"10","author(s) id":"7404054540;36238329500;","index keywords":"adaptation; amphibian; evolutionary biology; hypothesis testing; interspecific variation; morphology; ontogeny; phenotypic plasticity; Plethodontidae; Salamandroidea; Amphibia; animal; article; Europe; evolution; foot; genetics; histology; multivariate analysis; phenotype; phylogeny; Animals; Europe; Evolution; Foot; Multivariate Analysis; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Urodela","document type":"Article","cited by":"102","publication stage":"Final","art. no.":"216","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Adams D.C., Nistri A.","doi":"10.1186/1471-2148-10-216"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Buchanan B., Collard M., Edinborough K.","x":-794.9122314453125,"y":302.96551513671875,"id":"603","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-50149089960","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"33","year":"2008","page end":"11654","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-50149089960\u0026doi\u003d10.1073%2fpnas.0803762105\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d207c3e97d65e3b85ef338e790d4fd498","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","abstract":"Recently it has been suggested that one or more large extraterrestrial (ET) objects struck northern North America 12,900 ± 100 calendar years before present (calBP) [Firestone RB, et al. (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104: 16016-16021]. This impact is claimed to have triggered the Younger Dryas major cooling event and resulted in the extinction of the North American megafauna. The impact is also claimed to have caused major cultural changes and population decline among the Paleoindians. Here, we report a study in which ≈1,500 radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites in Canada and the United States were used to test the hypothesis that the ET resulted in population decline among the Paleoindians. Following recent studies [e.g., Gamble C, Davies W, Pettitt P, Hazelwood L, Richards M (2005) Camb Archaeol J 15:193-223), the summed probability distribution of the calibrated dates was used to identify probable changes in human population size between 15,000 and 9,000 calBP. Subsequently, potential biases were evaluated by modeling and spatial analysis of the dated occupations. The results of the analyses were not consistent with the predictions of extraterrestrial impact hypothesis. No evidence of a population decline among the Paleoindians at 12,900 ± 100 calBP was found. Thus, minimally, the study suggests the extraterrestrial impact hypothesis should be amended. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","source":"Scopus","title":"Paleoindian demography and the extraterrestrial impact hypothesis","volume":"105","page start":"11651","author(s) id":"11241802300;7102608373;24722595900;","index keywords":"carbon 14; archeology; article; astronomy; Canada; demography; paleontology; population growth; priority journal; United States; Canada; Humans; Indians, North American; Meteoroids; Models, Theoretical; Paleontology; Population Density; Probability; Time Factors; United States","document type":"Article","cited by":"99","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Clovis; Comet; Population decline; Radiocarbon; Summed probability distribution","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Buchanan B., Collard M., Edinborough K.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.0803762105"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Perttula T.K., Nelson B.","x":-2254.465576171875,"y":-214.983154296875,"id":"715","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84865834846","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2004","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Woodland and Caddo Archeology at the Broadway or Kanduts\u0027ah Kuhnihdahahdisa\u0027 Site (41SM273) on the City of Tyler-Lake Palestine WTP Project, Smith County, Texas","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Perttula T.K., Nelson B."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Eubanks P.N.","x":509.78350830078125,"y":-2415.54736328125,"id":"565","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84906660290","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2011","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Summary of the Red River Saline Project, 2011 Submitted to the Gulf Coast Survey","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Eubanks P.N."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Akridge D.G.","x":386.9787902832031,"y":-2434.160888671875,"id":"530","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-42049116970","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2008","page end":"1462","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-42049116970\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2007.10.013\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003da63653ddfae3a78bbe1546fb78b78362","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Salt is recognized by archaeologists as an important commodity due to the biological need for sodium and other cultural uses.

This study quantifies three of the most common evaporation techniques and provides insight into the production rates of salt and fuel requirements. Methods of calculation are provided for determining evaporation through (1) direct solar heating of brine, (2) applied external heat to a vessel, and (3) an immersed heated object (e.g., stone).

The method is based on our knowledge of isotopic patterns in plants, which are subject to taxonomic and environmental variability. While previous researchers have addressed isotopic variability amongst plants, no studies have looked extensively at a broad suite of taxa over multiple temporal scales from within the savanna biome so as to provide baseline data for palaeodietary and palaeoenvironmental studies. Here we document variations in the isotopic compositions of plants collected over two years from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, with respect to species and anatomical differences, and the influences of geological substrate and spatio-temporal shifts in climate. Results show that environmentally-induced carbon isotopic variations in plants within this region are generally smaller than 2‰, which is lower than what has been previously reported for plants compared across multiple habitat-types. These data suggest that δ13C differences of ∼2‰ or more (or ∼1‰ if the diet is predominantly C4) between animals from a given area reliably indicate real dietary differences. Plant δ15N values vary greatly between different microhabitats (by up to 4‰), responding to a range of environmental influences that may, in turn, significantly influence variation in animal δ15N values. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

One prominent example of this debate is Clovis technology (13,350-12,500 calendar years before present), which represents the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America. Clovis projectile points appear to have been made the same way regardless of region, but several studies have documented differences in shape that appear to be regional. Two processes have been proposed for shape variation: (1) stochastic mechanisms such as copy error (drift) and (2) Clovis groups adapting their hunting equipment to the characteristics of prey and local habitat. We used statistical analysis of Clovis-point flake-scar pattern and geometric morphometrics to examine whether drift alone could cause significant differences in the technology of Stone Age colonizing hunter-gatherers. Importantly, our analysis was intraregional to rule out a priori environmental adaptation. Our analysis confirmed that the production technique was the same across the sample, but we found significant shape differences in Clovis point populations made from distinct stone outcrops. Given that current archaeological evidence suggests stone outcrops were \"hubs\" of regional Clovis activity, our dichotomous, intraregional results quantitatively confirm that Clovis foragers engaged in two tiers of social learning. The lower, ancestral tier relates to point production and can be tied to conformist transmission of tool-making processes across the Clovis population. The upper, derived tier relates to point shape, which can be tied to drift that resulted from increased forager interaction at different stone-outcrop hubs and decreased forager interaction among groups using different outcrops. Given that Clovis artifacts represent the earliest widespread and currently recognizable remains of hunter-gatherers in North America, our results suggest that we need to alter our theoretical understanding of how quickly drift can occur within a colonizing population and create differences among socially learned technological characters. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Social learning and technological evolution during the Clovis colonization of the New World","funding text 1":"Our research would have been impossible if not for Ken Tankersley\u0027s foresight over a quarter-century ago in creating a method of accurately capturing fluted-point size, shape, and flake-scar pattern; in creating the Indiana–Kentucky–Ohio fluted-point database; and in generously making the database available on the Paleoindian Database of the Americas ( http://pidba.utk.edu/main.htm ) and in his dissertation ( Tankersley, 1989 ).

Tests for allometry and asymmetry were not significant. The test of morphological disparity indicates that Gahagan bifaces produced at the Mounds Plantation site occupy a more restricted range of morphospace than those produced at Gahagan Mound, providing indirect evidence for standardisation and diversity in Caddo biface production. While the sample includes a wide range of variation in biface shapes, the test of morphological integration indicates that Gahagan bifaces are significantly integrated, meaning that those traits used to characterise their shape (blade and base) vary in a coordinated manner.

The present report analyzes the adult dentition of hunter-gatherer populations from what is now Texas and compares them with adjacent samples of agriculturalists. These agriculturalist samples represent the Southwestern (Mimbres-Mogollon) and Southeastern (Caddo) cultural spheres. Nonmetric dental traits provide a useful means for evaluating the biological similarities between different populations. Mahalanobis distance analysis of these traits, drawn from 902 individuals, reveal relatively little morphological similarity between hunter-gatherer and farming groups. Except for a sample of Archaic foragers from the gulf coastal plain, hunter-gatherer samples are more similar to each other than to adjacent agriculturalists. Results suggest that Archaic populations were morphologically diverse, while there was relatively little gene flow between hunter-gatherer and farming populations during the Late Prehistoric period. The overall dissimilarity between hunter-gatherer. Mimbres, and Caddo samples suggests that each may have arisen from a relatively distant common ancestry.","source":"Scopus","title":"Biological relationships between foragers and farmers of South-Central North America: Nonmetric dental traits","volume":"77","page start":"99","author(s) id":"7406240864;26035656000;","document type":"Article","root":"true","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"0.0","pr_domain":"0.0","authors":"Taylor M., Creel D.","doi":"10.7183/0002-7316.77.1.99"},"color":"rgb(102,0,9)","size":47.904762268066406},{"label":"Walker C.P., Perttula T.K., Middlebrook T., Nelson B., Walters M.","x":-132.31912231445312,"y":415.2971496582031,"id":"975","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79951875178","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2009","page end":"8","source title":"ISAP Neios (The Newsletter of the International Society for Archaeological Prospection)","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Volunteer archaeogeophysical investigations at an historic caddo Indian site in East Texas","volume":"20","page start":"7","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Walker C.P., Perttula T.K., Middlebrook T., Nelson B., Walters M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Reeder R.L.","x":582.8159790039062,"y":-549.6040649414062,"id":"1242","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84883259328","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1983","page end":"26","source title":"Missouri Archaeologist","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"House excavations","volume":"44","page start":"13","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","authors":"Reeder R.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":521.55859375,"y":267.6738586425781,"id":"1336","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039201263","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"0","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.008964143426294821","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":536.201171875,"y":178.19174194335938,"id":"1330","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039234622","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"0","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.008964143426294821","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Walters M.","x":-2374.676513671875,"y":-350.8406066894531,"id":"737","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84897552782","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2008","page end":"114","source title":"Caddo Archeology Journal","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Life on jackson creek, smith county, texas: Archeological investigations of a 14th century caddo domicile at the leaning rock site (4ism325)","volume":"17","page start":"1","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Walters M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Rohlf F.J.","x":493.37060546875,"y":2066.96923828125,"id":"1464","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0033235691","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"1999","page end":"223","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0033235691\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs003579900054\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dafe1b218ad4917ce57cf2dee9936bc68","source title":"Journal of Classification","abstract":"The shape of a set of labeled points corresponds to those attributes of the configuration that are invariant to the effects of translation, rotation, and scale.

Via scanning electron microscopy, we characterized this physical weathering that increased the number of structural fractures and yielded higher numbers of liberated biochar fragments. This was hypothesized to be due to the graphitic sheet expansion accompanying water sorption coupled with comminution. These fragments can be on the microscale and the nanoscale but are still carbon-rich particles with no detectable alteration in the oxygen:carbon ratio from that of the original biochar. However, these particles are now easily dissolved and could be moved by infiltration.

To address perceived projectile point variability in the region, assemblages from several localities on the southern High Plains are examined for statistical differences in shape. Digital photographs of projectile points are used to digitize point outlines. Landmark coordinate data then are used to delineate 10 interlandmark characters. Multivariate analysis of projectile points ftom eight assemblages reveals that the primary difference in point shape lies between long points with narrow bases and short points with wide bases. Analysis of characters by raw material type or source discerned no significant differences. Variation in point form represented by most of the assemblages, including the Plainview and Milnesand type assemblages, overlaps to a significant degree. The Lubbock Lake FA5-17 assemblage, consisting of long points with narrow bases, appears most distinct in terms of shape and raw material selection indicating the contemporaneity of different point forms and perhaps technological traditions in the region by approximately 10,000 years ago.","source":"Scopus","title":"A morphometric approach to assessing late Paleoindian projectile point variability on the southern High Plains","volume":"52","page start":"279","author(s) id":"11241802300;7404680660;7202966775;7402869675;","document type":"Article","cited by":"19","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Digitizing; Late Paleoindian; Multivariate analyses; Projectile points; Southern High Plains","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Buchanan B., Johnson E., Strauss R.E., Lewis P.J.","doi":"10.1179/pan.2007.019"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Fulton R.L., Webb C.H.","x":193.6566619873047,"y":18.062822341918945,"id":"1171","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649297557","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1953","page end":"24","source title":"Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The Bellevue Mound: A Pre-Caddoan Site, Bossier Parish, Louisiana","volume":"24","page start":"18","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00398406374501992","authors":"Fulton R.L., Webb C.H."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Okumura M., Araujo A.G.M.","x":342.4763488769531,"y":1565.960693359375,"id":"184","attributes":{"funding details":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento CientÃ­fico e TecnolÃ³gico, CNPq: 307953/2011-4, 159776/2010-4\n\nFundaÃ§Ã£o de Amparo Ã  Pesquisa do Estado de SÃ£o Paulo, FAPESP: 2010/06453-9, 2009/54720-9","eid":"2-s2.0-84895755843","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2014","page end":"71","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84895755843\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2014.02.009\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003df7fbf4a955e1bd6cbfe5818019377a36","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"Irrespective of the great number of archaeological sites from Southern Brazil presenting bifacial stemmed points, not many detailed studies on their morphological evolution have been carried out so far.

Garivaldino presents a range of dates from 11,660 to 7540calBP. Multivariate statistics applied to both traditional and geometric morphometric analyses failed to reveal any important changes in shape through time. However, the coefficients of variation presented a significant increase through time in three measurements related to projectile point neck and stem. The absence of change in shape might be related to small group size and low level of cultural innovation. Such cultural stability might be related to novelty-avoiding mechanisms or the operation of a meta-tradition that would be selected in very stable environments. On the other hand, the increase in the variation of linear measurements through time might suggest an increase in population size and copying errors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Long-term cultural stability in hunter-gatherers: A case study using traditional and geometric morphometric analysis of lithic stemmed bifacial points from Southern Brazil","funding text 1":"We would like to thank Pedro Augusto Mentz Ribeiro ( in memoriam ) for the careful and detailed publication of the Garivaldino data.

Carbon and nitrogen isotopes of human bone collagen were analyzed from five sites in west-central Illinois, dating from the Middle Woodland to Mississippian periods, and the results contrasted with evidence from neighboring river valleys and the wider Eastern Woodlands area. Contrary to speculation, neither the initial adoption of maize nor subsequent intensification in its use were correlated with status, gender, or age. A striking bimodal distribution was observed in consumption of native and introduced crops; growing or eating small amounts of maize was apparently not practiced. Fluoride dating confirms the burials are contemporary, and the pattern persists over several hundred years. Possible explanations include issues related to the economics of maize growing, household requirements for storage, exchange, or levies, or individual taste. Also notable were earlier-than-expected dates for intensive exploitation of the maize in this area, in the early Late Woodland, possibly as early as A.D. 400. Nitrogen isotope ratios were higher for males at all sites and time periods; the cause may have been greater access to dietary protein, or could be the result of physiological differences.

Two-dimensional perturbation-based correlation infrared spectroscopy (2D-PCIS) was used to study the biochar formation process in three taxonomically different plant biomass, under oxygen-limited conditions along a heat-treatment- temperature gradient (HTT; 200-650 °C). Results from 2D-PCIS pointed to the systematic, HTT-induced defragmenting of lignocellulose H-bonding network and demethylenation/demethylation, oxidation, or dehydroxylation/dehydrogenation of lignocellulose fragments as the primary reactions controlling biochar properties along the HTT gradient. The cleavage of OH-O-type H-bonds, oxidation of free primary hydroxyls to carboxyls (carboxylation; HTT ≤ 500 °C), and their subsequent dehydrogenation/dehydroxylation (HTT \u0026gt; 500 °C) controlled surface charge on the biochars; while the dehydrogenation of methylene groups, which yielded increasingly condensed structures (R-CH 2-R →R\u003dCH-R →R\u003dC\u003dR), controlled biochar recalcitrance. Variations in biochar properties across plant biomass type were attributable to taxa-specific transformations. For example, apparent inefficiencies in the cleavage of wood-specific H-bonds, and their subsequent oxidation to carboxyls, lead to lower surface charge in wood biochars (compared to grass biochars). Both nontaxa and taxa-specific transformations highlighted by 2D-PCIS could have significant implications for biochar functioning in fire-impacted or biochar-amended systems. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","source":"Scopus","title":"Generalized two-dimensional perturbation correlation infrared spectroscopy reveals mechanisms for the development of surface charge and recalcitrance in plant-derived biochars","volume":"46","page start":"10641","author(s) id":"24073079000;7007123830;44161198700;57203303374;","index keywords":"Biochar; Condensed structures; Dehydroxylations; Formation process; H-bonding networks; H-bonds; Methylene groups; Plant biomass; Primary reaction; Two-dimensional perturbation; Biomass; Carboxylation; Cellulose; Infrared spectroscopy; Lignin; Oxidation; Surface charge; carbene; carboxyl group; hydroxyl group; lignocellulose; oxygen; amenity; biotransformation; cellulose; charcoal; chemical bonding; environmental degradation; infrared spectroscopy; lignin; oxidation; phytomass; article; biomass; carboxylation; cation exchange; chemical structure; degradation; dehydrogenation; demethylation; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; environmental factor; heat treatment; hydrogen bond; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; oxidation; surface charge; two dimensional perturbation based correlation infrared spectroscopy; Biomass; Charcoal; Hydrogen Bonding; Lignin; Oxidation-Reduction; Plants; Poaceae; Spectrophotometry, Infrared; Surface Properties; Temperature; Wood","document type":"Article","cited by":"92","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Harvey O.R., Herbert B.E., Kuo L.-J., Louchouarn P.","doi":"10.1021/es302971d"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Schambach F.F.","x":-2340.880126953125,"y":-1990.2552490234375,"id":"924","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-4344699526","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2001","page end":"50","source title":"Arkansas Archeologist","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Fourche maline and its neighbors: Observations on an important woodland period culture of the trans-Mississippi South","volume":"40","page start":"21","cited by":"5","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Schambach F.F."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Trubitt","x":129.58877563476562,"y":-1080.2254638671875,"id":"1129","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649291391","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Archaeology of the Caddo","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"Mary Beth Forthcoming Caddo in the Saline River Valley of Arkansas: The Borderlands Project and the Hughes Site","authors":"Trubitt"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Anderson W.P.","x":629.1385498046875,"y":1641.7098388671875,"id":"240","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-70849091679","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1990","page end":"54","source title":"Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The beginnings of Phoenician pottery; vessel shape, style, and ceramic technology in the early phase of the Phoenician Iron Age","volume":"279","page start":"35","cited by":"9","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Anderson W.P."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Passey B.H., Robinson T.F., Ayliffe L.K., Cerling T.E., Sphonheimer M., Dearing M.D., Roeder B.L., Ehleringer J.R.","x":-2187.546630859375,"y":-450.1660461425781,"id":"647","attributes":{"funding details":"National Science Foundation, NSF\n\nDavid and Lucile Packard Foundation","eid":"2-s2.0-22144498801","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2005","page end":"1470","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-22144498801\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2005.03.015\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003de2aa889b1a60d7cdbfda1abc689b616f","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"The carbon isotope fractionation between tooth enamel bioapatite, breath CO2, and diet was measured for voles, rabbits, pigs, and cattle on controlled diets.

However, the accuracy of these assessments has never been evaluated. Here we report a study in which geometric morphometrics and multivariate statistics were used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In the course of the analyses, we controlled for the impact of three potential confounding factors: allometry, differences in raw material quality, and resharpening. The analyses show that blade shape distinguishes Clovis points from both Folsom points and Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities and differences in blade shape among the types are independent of allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings suggest that the type definitions for Clovis, Folsom and Plainview need to be altered. They also have implications for typing specimens that lack other defining characters (e.g. channel flakes, flutes). Lastly, the absence of resharpening effects raises questions about the validity of the reduction thesis. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It has long been of interest to archaeologists because of its potential to inform them about the presence of past human occupation and to offer clues regarding the type and intensity of human activity. A wide variety of methods have been developed in both soil science and in archaeology to extract and measure soil P, resulting in a tremendous amount of data and a wide array of interpretations, but also considerable confusion over appropriateness of methods and terminology. The primary purpose of this paper is to address these issues by clarifying soil P analyses. Anthropogenic additions of phosphorus to the soil come from human refuse and waste, burials, the products of animal husbandry in barns, pens, and on livestock paths, or intentional enrichment from soil fertilizer. Once added to the soil, phosphorus in its common form as phosphate is stable and generally immobile in soils. Soil P comes in many forms, organized for the purposes of this paper on the basis of extraction and measurement procedures as (1) extraction for available P (Pav); (2) portable field techniques (the spot test or ring test); (3) chemical digestion of a soil sample for total P (Ptot); (4) extractions of inorganic P (Pin) for fractionation studies and extractions to look at individual compounds of P; (5) measurements of organic P (Porg); and (6) extractions for total elemental analysis. To compare the suitability of various extractants as the \"best\" indicator of human input and activity we subjected samples from three very different archaeological sites (Lubbock Lake, TX; Hulburt Creek, IA; British Camp, WA) to four methods of soil P extraction: perchloric acid digestion (Ptot), sulfuric-nitric acid extraction Ptot), hydrochloric acid extraction after ignition (Pin), and citric acid extraction (Pav). Further, methods of measurement were compared via colorimetry vs. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometry, and the two methods of supposed \"total P\" were both measured via ICP. In general, the stronger extractants yielded more soil P, but the result are not clear-cut. Likely variables include the intensity of occupation, nature of the parent material, and postdepositional weathering (e.g., the addition of dust). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, there is a general realization within the archaeological community that much more information can be derived from radiocarbon dating if the samples are taken from coherent, well-chosen contexts and if any available substantive archaeological information is included in the data analysis. This paper describes how the Bayesian approach to statistical data analysis can be used for the calibration of groups of radiocarbon results in situations where archaeological information is available a priori about the relationships between the contexts being dated. Recent innovations in the implementation of the Bayesian paradigm are used and the methodology is illustrated by the analysis of data arising from two archaeological excavations. © 1992.","source":"Scopus","title":"Calibration of radiocarbon results pertaining to related archaeological events","funding text 1":"Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to Stuart Needham for making available to us the archaeological information and radiocarbon results from Runnymede Bridge.

Substantial status- and gender-related differences in burial style are apparent. Some burials are associated with large quantities of prestigious grave goods, suggesting high status. Mass graves of young adult females with skeletal indicators of poor health suggest low status and nutritional stress. Nitrogen isotope ratios of bone collagen show that high status individuals ate much more animal protein, but carbon isotope ratios of collagen suggest these individuals ate only ca. 10% less maize than lower status individuals. Apatite carbon isotopes show low status females ate ca. 60% more maize than high status individuals, which confirms the large nitrogen isotope difference of females in mass graves. These results indicate high and low status individuals had significantly different diet compositions and nutritional qualities. The stable isotope evidence supports paleopathological data for status-related differences in health, and dental morphological data for presumed genetic differences in origin. These data also provide insights into the nutrition- and health-related dimension of regional hierarchical organization of settlements and social inequality of this complex chiefdom in the greater Cahokia region. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

From a heat treatment temperature of about 600 °C upwards, the general shape of the 13C NMR spectra, attained with low applied magnetic field, is very similar for both chars, with a strong resonance line near 125 ppm from TMS (carbon nuclei in aromatic planes). The analysis of the evolution of the main parameters associated with this resonance line shows a behavior typical of heat-treated carbon materials, which is interpreted on the basis of the structural evolution of both chars. We show that the results are well understood when a comparison is made with the features of the 13C NMR spectrum of polycrystalline graphite.","source":"Scopus","title":"Investigation of biomass- and polymer-based carbon materials using 13C high-resolution solid-state NMR","funding text 1":"This work was partially supported by Brazilian agencies CNPq, CAPES, FINEP and FAPESP.

The complex dates to the period between a.d. 500 and 1100/1200, and a wide range of activities and site functions are inferred for the three types of habitation sites that are recognized. The Kent Creek and Sam Wahl sites are identified as residential bases where people lived in pithouses while procuring, processing, storing, and consuming a wide range of wild plant foods. Mesquite beans and shin oak acorns have been identified as possible staples, but other plants such as goosefoot and buffalo gourds also may have been important foods. Although no cultigens have been found, this situation does not preclude the possibility that limited horticulture was practiced at residential sites. Occupations at these villages were at least seasonal (i.e., during late summer to fall harvest and into winter) and may have been biseasonal (i.e., during planting and then again during fall harvest and into winter). Palo Duro peoples lived in rockshelters and open camps at various times of the year and for different reasons. Some rockshelters were occupied on a sporadic and ephemeral basis, while others were more intensively used and may have served as relatively permanent bases. Some camp sites were little more than specialized processing sites where baking and grinding of plant foods were the primary activities, while others were multifunctional bases where considerable hunting and process-ing of animals was done. Deer and small animals appear to have been the principal game animals. Bison were hunted but do not appear to have been a major food resource, and the evidence suggests that populations may have been relatively low. Palo Duro culture is now viewed as representing semisedentary peoples who maintained a high degree of residential mobility in order to exploit a wide range of resources that were locally available and abundant on a seasonal basis. Sites of this complex are found mainly in the Caprock Canyonlands, an ecological subregion that offered the most predictable and widest range of subsistence resources (water, plants, and animals) within a relatively arid landscape. The home territory for Palo Duro peoples was in the upper drainages of the Red and Brazos Rivers, although they may have ranged on occasion north into the Canadian River valley, east into the Rolling Plains, south into the upper Colorado River drainage, and west onto the Llano Estacado. Human burials provide evidence of widespread violence in and around the Caprock Canyonlands during the Late Prehistoric I period, and the Palo Duro culture may have come into periodic contact with enemy peoples to the north and east (Lake Creek or Plains Woodland groups) and to the south and southeast (Blow Out Mountain and other undefined groups). Palo Duro peoples did maintain some form of cultural contact with the Jornada Mogollon peoples of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas over a long period of time. There appears to be a significant amount of Jornada Mogollon cultural influence across the southern Llano Estacado and into the Caprock Canyonlands, and the Palo Duro Complex exhibits many traits (e.g., imported brownware pottery and pithouse architectural styles) that were derived, whether directly or indirectly, from the Jornada Mogollon region. In addition, the similarities between the subsistence and settlement patterns proposed for the Palo Duro Complex and those proposed for their eastern Jornada Mogollon neighbors may be more than a mere coincidence. In summary, it is unclear whether the Palo Duro Complex represents an actual migration of Jornada Mogollon or related peoples or whether it simply represents indigenous Southern Plains people who came under the widespread influence of Jornada Mogollon culture or something much more complex.

Archaeological interpretations have tended to associate maize dependence with the rise of major centres, such as Cahokia. These models, based upon volume and ubiquity of maize in village site middens and features, frequently contrast the key role of maize in regional centres with the situation in smaller, remote communities. Mississippian inhabitants of frontier villages, for instances, are assumed to be less maize-dependent than their counterparts in larger and more complex communities. Recent analyses of stable carbon isotope ratios have, however, called into question standard archaeological interpretations. A series of δ13C values that characterize the period of agricultural intensification in the central Mississippi and Illinois river valleys identifies significant maize dependence at locations some distance from Cahokia during its period of major regional influence. Time transgressive trends apparent in maize ubiquity for the Cahokia region also stand in contrast to those seen in diachronic sequences of δ13C values. In this paper, we present newly generated δ13C values for five sites from the central Mississippi and Illinois river regions. Archaeological and isotopic evidence for maize-dependence is evaluated for biases that may underlie the seeming contradictory diachronic and synchronic patterning evident in the two data sets. © 1991.","source":"Scopus","title":"Isotopic and archaeological interpretations of diet in the central mississippi valley","volume":"18","page start":"319","author(s) id":"6701752370;7006680434;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; carbon dating; dietary analysis; isotopic interpretation; maize dependence; USA, Mississippi Valley","document type":"Article","cited by":"69","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Cahokia; Carbon Isotopes; Diet; Late Woodland; Maize; Mississippian","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Buikstra J.E., Milner G.R.","doi":"10.1016/0305-4403(91)90068-Z"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Scott G.R., Turner II C.G.","x":2476.365966796875,"y":925.5653076171875,"id":"749","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0003436555","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1997","cited by":"531","source title":"The Anthropology of Modern Human Teeth","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Scott G.R., Turner II C.G."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Hedges J.I., Ertel J.R.","x":-1774.8822021484375,"y":2326.792236328125,"id":"278","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0020090761","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"2","year":"1982","page end":"178","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0020090761\u0026doi\u003d10.1021%2fac00239a007\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dd53c198e524f43a86b24fbfc7a6a8191","source title":"Analytical Chemistry","abstract":"Lignin compounds are high molecular weight phenolic polymers that occur In the woody tissues of vascular plants and In soil and sedimentary organic matter.

Lithic analysts have questioned two types of triangle, Levanna and Madison, as valid analytic units as they are quantifiably indeterminate when measured using caliper methods such as length and width. The geometric morphometric analysis here takes outline data from a previously studied collection of projectile points and uses elliptical Fourier harmonics analysis combined with principal components and discriminant functions tests to objectively define and separate the two types of projectile point. The result is a bimodal distribution of types that conforms to the traditional typological classification system for the region, in contrast to recent scholarship that conflates the two types into one.

In the middle of this period, people shifted dwellings from pithouses to pueblos, a shift previously viewed as the pivotal transformation of Mimbres society. In this paper we show that significant changes in Mimbres society began in the A.D. 800s. Trends in the construction methods of communal pit structures, the placement of dedicatory items within them, their ritual retirements, and their long-lived significance within Mimbres villages, reflect other changes that occurred in Mimbres society. We contend that in the A.D. 8OOs, rapid change based on strong connections with the Hohokam of southern Arizona and agricultural intensification began a trajectory that culminated in the Classic Mimbres pueblos of the A.D. 1000s and early 1100s. © 2003 by the Society for American Archaeology.","source":"Scopus","title":"New interpretations of mimbres public architecture and space: Implications for cultural change","volume":"68","page start":"67","author(s) id":"26035656000;25221027700;","document type":"Article","cited by":"50","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Creel D., Anyon R.","doi":"10.2307/3557033"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Kay M., Sabo III G., Merletti R.","x":763.1065063476562,"y":-262.0296325683594,"id":"377","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33746158735","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1989","page end":"157","source title":"Contributions to Spiro Archaeology: Mound Excavations and Regional Perspectives","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Late Prehistoric Settlement Patterning: A View from Three Caddoan Civic-Ceremonial Centers in Northwest Arkansas","page start":"129","cited by":"12","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Kay M., Sabo III G., Merletti R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Eubanks P.N., Smith E.C.","x":410.8852844238281,"y":-2516.630615234375,"id":"563","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84906710086","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2012","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Report of the 2011 Passport in Time Project at Drake\u0027s Sal Works (16WN30)","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Eubanks P.N., Smith E.C."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Hester T.R.","x":2466.15576171875,"y":1029.8828125,"id":"783","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0006248857","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1988","page end":"64","source title":"Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Chronological framework for lower pecos prehistory","volume":"59","page start":"53","cited by":"15","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Hester T.R."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Thurmond J.P.","x":340.86962890625,"y":-671.0852661132812,"id":"1236","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-69549098542","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1990","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Archeology of the Cypress Creek Drainage Basin, North-Eastern Texas and Northwestern Louisiana","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","title":"[No title available]","authors":"Thurmond J.P."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Costin C.L.","x":656.3937377929688,"y":1986.4566650390625,"id":"1436","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-43849089905","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"2005","page end":"1107","source title":"Handbook of Archaeological Methods","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Craft production","page start":"1034","cited by":"58","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Costin C.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Canuto M.A., Yaeger J.","x":489.4060363769531,"y":264.06298828125,"id":"1311","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85071790730","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2012","page end":"15","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85071790730\u0026doi\u003d10.4324%2f9780203354933-8\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d51e5d8001ff9367ba984c961efb4dd3e","source title":"The Archaeology of Communities: A New World Perspective","abstract":"With this volume, we hope to invigorate the study of past communities. Archaeologists have long pursued theoretically and methodologically innovative research on social institutions like polities, households, and regions. However, research on the community has stagnated, despite a multitude of sociological, ethnographic, and ethnohistoric studies that have shown it to be one of the most important and meaningful contexts for social interaction. Given the community\u0027s central place in most societies, it is incumbent upon archaeologists to contribute to this study by finding ways to recover ancient communities embedded within the archaeological record. First, however, archaeologists must define \"community\" and then seek ways to make that definition archaeologically meaningful. Because we feel this goal is best achieved through comparative analysis, this volume brings together ten studies in which scholars with diverse models of community examine specific archaeological cases in the Americas, from Formative-period South America to nineteenth-century Appalachia. Joyce Marcus and William Isbell each provide concluding chapters that examine the themes unifying the contributions and assess the potential contributions of what we call an \"archaeology of communities\". © 2000 Marcello A.

By re-analysing data from a recently published paper in which the authors sought to identify the calendar date of the eruption of fourteenth-century AD Kaharoa Tephra, a key marker in New Zealand prehistory, it is shown that Bayesian methods can be used to draw together a coherent collection of radiocarbon data, undertake formal outlier detection, and include prior information. Regardless of the calibration curve adopted, the distribution of likely dates for the Kaharoa eruption is multimodal. By including prior information from wiggle-matched dendrochronology, the uncertainty on the estimate of the calendar date is reduced from a range of about 100 years to about 25 years (i.e., 648-623 cal. BP, with modes at 638 and 632 cal. BP). Using sensitivity analysis, however, it is shown that such estimates are affected by the quality and nature of the prior information available. As a result, we urge tephrochronologists to seek fastidiously both high-quality radiocarbon data and reliable stratigraphic sequences that might inform future geochronological model building.","source":"Scopus","title":"Bayesian tools for tephrochronology","volume":"13","page start":"639","author(s) id":"7102927862;7003799879;24326370800;","index keywords":"Bayesian analysis; Holocene; radiocarbon dating; sensitivity analysis; tephrochronology","document type":"Article","cited by":"42","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Archaeology; Bayesian statistics; Geochronology; Holocene; Kaharoa Tephra; New Zealand; Radiocarbon dating; Tephrochronology","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Buck C.E., Higham T.F.G., Lowe D.J.","doi":"10.1191/0959683603hl652ft"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Stuiver M., Reimer P.J.","x":515.3358154296875,"y":183.97242736816406,"id":"1309","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0027464565","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1993","page end":"230","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-0027464565\u0026doi\u003d10.1017%2fS0033822200013904\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003db076b9d196679a5c9fc51c53d49398ba","access type":"Open Access","source title":"Radiocarbon","abstract":"The Age Calibration Program, CALIB, published in 1986 and amended in 1987 is here amended anew.

The main difference between the two transects is the steeper elevational gradient for mean annual and summer precipitation in the southern transect. For any given species, we found that isotopic differences between individual plants growing at the same site commonly equal differences measured for plants along the entire altitudinal gradient. In C3 plants, δ13Cleaf values become slightly enriched at the lowest elevations, the opposite of trends identified in more humid regions. Apparently, increasing water-use efficiency with drought stress offsets the influence of other biotic and abiotic factors that operate to decrease isotopic discrimination with elevation. For some species shared by the two transects (e.g., Pinus edulis and Cercocarpus montanus), δ13Cleaf values are dramatically depleted at sites that receive more than 550 mm mean annual precipitation, roughly the boundary (pedalfer-pedocal) at which soils commonly fill to field capacity in summer and carbonates are leached. We hypothesize that, in summer-wet areas, this may represent the boundary at which drought stress overtakes other factors in determining the sign of δ13Cleaf with elevation. The opposition of isotopic trends with elevation in arid versus humid regions cautions against standard correction for elevation in comparative studies of δ13Cleaf.","source":"Scopus","title":"Leaf δ13C variability with elevation, slope aspect, and precipitation in the southwest United States","funding text 1":"Acknowledgements Funding was provided by NSF grant EAR-9418268 to S.W.

Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition. We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment. Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces. A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included.

Clovis may be the best documented Paleoamerican culture in North America, but much remains to be learned about the movement and interactions of Clovis peoples. Similarities among Clovis points from geographically diverse locations have led some researchers to suggest that a uniform projectile point technology existed across North America during Clovis times. Others have rejected this idea, proposing local and independent technological adaptations to different regional environments. To investigate these ideas, we used digital morphometrics to analyze 50 Clovis points from nine different contexts. First, 3D surface models of the points were created with a portable laser scanner. Next, these models were digitally cross-sectioned through both faces, yielding two-dimensional isoheight contours of flake scar patterns that reflect the original reduction techniques used to shape the projectile points. In the final step, the contours were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis into Fourier coefficient series, and patterns of variation and symmetry were explored with principal components analysis. When compared to modern Clovis point replicas made by an expert knapper, the flake scar contours of the ancient Clovis points showed little morphological variation and a large degree of bifacial symmetry. Our results support the existence of a widespread standardized \"Clovis\" knapping technique, most likely transmitted through direct interaction between knappers from different groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Flake scar patterns of Clovis points analyzed with a new digital morphometrics approach: Evidence for direct transmission of technological knowledge across early North America","volume":"39","page start":"3018","author(s) id":"36160611700;7007023049;36652593800;6506757327;","index keywords":"archaeological evidence; artifact; digital image; morphometry; Pleistocene; principal component analysis; three-dimensional modeling; tool use; North America","document type":"Article","cited by":"43","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"3D scanning; Contour analysis; Lithic technology; Morphology; Paleoindians; Pleistocene","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Sholts S.B., Stanford D.J., Flores L.M., Wärmländer S.K.T.S.","doi":"10.1016/j.jas.2012.04.049"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Hart John P., Perttula T.K.","x":-473.15985107421875,"y":-441.1004333496094,"id":"892","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79960018867","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2010","page end":"228","source title":"Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The Washington square mound site and a southeastern ceremonial complex style zone among the caddo of northeastern Texas","volume":"35","page start":"199","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Hart John P., Perttula T.K."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Wallace B.J.","x":395.4371032714844,"y":-671.822265625,"id":"1245","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-33750579446","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1962","page end":"68","source title":"Bulletin of the Oklahoma Anthropological Society","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Prehistoric House Patterns of Oklahoma","volume":"10","page start":"27","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","authors":"Wallace B.J."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Beck Jr. R.A.","x":395.65093994140625,"y":-653.7640380859375,"id":"1208","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77955171436","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2007","page end":"24","source title":"The Durable House: House Society Models in Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"The durable house: Material, metaphor, and structure","page start":"3","cited by":"18","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.0049800796812749","authors":"Beck Jr. R.A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":565.29443359375,"y":130.3986358642578,"id":"1337","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039195160","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"0","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.008964143426294821","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Galloway P.","x":-497.6753845214844,"y":-652.1717529296875,"id":"836","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0013320193","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1989","cited by":"53","publication stage":"Final","source title":"The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex: Artifacts and Analysis","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex: Artifacts and Analysis","authors":"Galloway P."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":235.63327026367188,"y":-1054.1729736328125,"id":"1143","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649300751","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1972","source title":"1972 Caddo Conference.

One of the main drivers for social development, but also for anthropogenic changes in the environment, is surely shifts in population density. To evaluate group sizes and population density we need archaeological proxies. Similar to other studies, we use 14C dates to reconstruct the intensity of prehistoric activities. A comparison of the human impact from pollen data with a quantification based on 14C dates proves a correlation which supports our appreciation of the value of sum-calibrated probabilities of radiometric measurements as a proxy for demographic developments. The large amount of usable dates in this study not only enables us to draw general conclusions on a supraregional level, but also makes it possible for us to compare the character of different areas on a regional scale. As a result, we reconstruct a significant rise in population between 4100 and 3500 cal BC and a degression around 3350-3100 cal BC, followed by a reiterated increase for the Funnel Beaker West and North Groups.

Depictions of quotidian realities, such as portraiture or humans impersonating supernaturals, cannot be identified in this material, despite common claims to the contrary. Moreover, references are primarily to the celestial realm of a layered cosmos.","source":"Scopus","title":"On the subject matter of southeastern ceremonial complex art","volume":"20","page start":"129","author(s) id":"7006611243;35412583800;55606543500;","document type":"Article","cited by":"54","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Knight Jr. V.J., Brown J.A., Lankford G.E."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Tine A., Tieszen L.L.","x":-2184.484619140625,"y":-141.36199951171875,"id":"726","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84897520721","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1997","page end":"137","source title":"Two Caddoan Farmsteads in the Red River Valley","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Bioarchaeology","page start":"121","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Tine A., Tieszen L.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Cheetham Paul N.","x":47.01765060424805,"y":233.25350952148438,"id":"1004","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79951896811","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2008","page end":"582","source title":"Handbook of Landscape Archaeology","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Noninvasive subsurface mapping techniques, satellite and aerial imagery in landscape archaeology","page start":"562","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Cheetham Paul N."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"McConaughy M.A.","x":308.25982666015625,"y":-1073.6920166015625,"id":"1096","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649323443","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2007","page end":"116","source title":"Architectural Variability in the Southeast","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"A Comparison of Burned Mississippian Houses from Illinois","page start":"101","cited by":"6","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"McConaughy M.A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Jackson H.K., Scott S.L., Schambach F.F.","x":-2066.174560546875,"y":828.2892456054688,"id":"1398","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-84897493732","pr_indegree_normalized":"0.00199203187250996","year":"2012","page end":"85","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84897493732\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dc8e8de56baf887a2f28243d4cd4ab3ee","source title":"The Archaeology of the Caddo","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"At the house of the priest: Faunal remains from the Crenshaw site (3MI6), Southwest Arkansas","page start":"47","author(s) id":"24528315000;55415718000;14422859900;","document type":"Book Chapter","cited by":"4","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"2.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Jackson H.K., Scott S.L., Schambach F.F."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":318.1659851074219,"y":-1108.37841796875,"id":"1131","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649287618","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Buchanan B., O\u0027Brien M.J., Collard M.","x":662.2702026367188,"y":1784.382568359375,"id":"176","attributes":{"funding details":"National Science Foundation, NSF\n\nSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, SSHRC\n\nBritish Columbia Knowledge Development Fund, BCKDF\n\nCanada Research Chairs\n\nCanada Foundation for Innovation, CFI\n\nSimon Fraser University, SFU\n\nUniversity of Missouri, MU","eid":"2-s2.0-84898651207","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2014","page end":"162","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-84898651207\u0026doi\u003d10.1007%2fs12520-013-0168-x\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d22973a659097bde48b5a0541293f79e1","source title":"Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences","abstract":"Researchers have debated the existence of regional variation in Clovis points for over 60 years. Here, we report an attempt to resolve this argument using a large sample of Clovis points from dated assemblages and a suite of shape analysis methods known as geometric morphometrics. The study tested the two main hypotheses that have been put forward in the debate: the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis, which holds that Clovis points do not vary regionally, and the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis, which holds that there is regional variation as a consequence of Clovis groups adjusting their food-getting toolkits to local conditions. We used discriminant function analysis and a multivariate extension of the t test to assess whether differences in shape exist at two scales. The first set of analyses compared points from the most obvious environmental regions in North America, the East and the West. The second set of analyses investigated differences among points from subregions within the East and West. The analyses revealed significant differences between points from the East and the West and among points from some subregions. Follow-up analyses demonstrated that these differences are not the result of the most common confounding factors, raw material quality and resharpening. As such, the analyses support the regional environmental adaptation hypothesis rather than the continent-wide adaptation hypothesis. We conclude from this that Clovis people modified their points to suit the characteristics of local prey and/or the habitats in which they hunted. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","source":"Scopus","title":"Continent-wide or region-specific?

Benzenepolycarboxylic acids (BPCA) are used as molecular markers to quantify and characterize BC in soils and sediments using gas chromatography for BPCA separation (GC-BPCA). Recently, this method was refined for BC analysis in seawater using high performance liquid chromatography (LC-BPCA), which omits the cleaning steps and derivatization necessary in GC analysis. As yet it is not clear whether the two analytical methods yield similar results. Here we apply both methods to a suite of laboratory produced charcoals derived from wood and grass. We found systematically lower total BPCA-C contents and larger analytical variability for all tested charcoals when using GC-BPCA compared to LC-BPCA, the latter giving 1.5 ± 0.3 times higher yields for the charcoal samples formed at 275-700 °C At lower and higher pyrolysis temperatures the differences between the two analytical methods were larger. The main reason for the differences between the two methods is the loss of BPCA during sample preparation for GC analysis. We propose a correction factor of 1.5 to account for at least part of these losses. No qualitative biases, i.e. towards more or less functionalized BPCAs, were observed between the two methods. The relative contribution of mellitic acid C to total BPCA-C, a measure for the degree of condensation of BC, was the same in the two analytical techniques. Qualitative differences between wood and grass charcoals as detected by both methods were small. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Comparison of gas with liquid chromatography for the determination of benzenepolycarboxylic acids as molecular tracers of black carbon","funding text 1":"We would like to thank the Associate Editor Klaas G.J.

Of these, 39 dates are from sites assigned to the Smoky Hill phase of central and north-central Kansas; the other six are from sites assigned to the Steed-Kisker phase or south end of the Nebraska phase. All dates were assayed by AMS dating, and all were run on annual plants or residue from ceramics. Before assessing the chronology as reflected by these dates, we consider the advantages of using annual deposits rather than wood charcoal for dating and illustrate the practical effects for Central Plains tradition chronology by comparing the distribution of ages of previously-obtained age determinations on wood charcoal with the distribution of ages on annual plants. The analysis shows that dating annual plants produces a tighter and more objectively interpreted age distribution. The calibrated dates are then evaluated and the implications for Central Plains tradition chronology are discussed.","source":"Scopus","title":"Interpreting AMS radiocarbon age determinations from selected Central Plains tradition sites","volume":"56","page start":"3","author(s) id":"14422669400;47560925000;","document type":"Article","cited by":"9","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"AMS radiocarbon dates; Annual plants ceramic residue; Central Plains tradition; Smoky Hill phase","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Roper D.C., Adair M.J.","doi":"10.1179/pan.2011.002"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Mitchell Sharon A.","x":-545.4860229492188,"y":-632.1480102539062,"id":"898","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-79959985687","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2000","cited by":"2","publication stage":"Final","source title":"Data Salvage Project: Greasy Creek Study","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"Data Salvage Project: Greasy Creek Study","authors":"Mitchell Sharon A."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Hall R.L.","x":-376.032470703125,"y":-679.6301879882812,"id":"823","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-0141934545","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1997","cited by":"214","publication stage":"Final","source title":"An Archaeology of the Soul: North American Indian Belief and Ritual","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"An Archaeology of the Soul: North American Indian Belief and Ritual","authors":"Hall R.L."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Early A.M.","x":258.8381042480469,"y":-1042.043701171875,"id":"1100","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649326478","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1974","page end":"5","source title":"Field Notes","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Archeology, the Hedges Site, 3HS60","volume":"116","page start":"3","cited by":"3","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Early A.M."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Gearey B.R., Marshall P., Hamilton D.","x":-677.9974365234375,"y":383.1310119628906,"id":"618","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-67349230572","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","issue":"7","year":"2009","page end":"1487","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-67349230572\u0026doi\u003d10.1016%2fj.jas.2009.03.003\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003d4133a84ba63278b32ac51b761f559f55","source title":"Journal of Archaeological Science","abstract":"This paper presents a case study aimed at correlating archaeological \u0027events\u0027 (obtained from radiocarbon measurements and dendrochronology) from the site of Sutton Common with a radiocarbon-dated pollen sequence obtained from a palaeochannel deposit adjacent to the area of the main archaeological activity. It demonstrates the use of a Bayesian approach to quantifying whether the timing of palynological \u0027events\u0027 interpreted as reflecting anthropogenic impacts are likely to be associated with archaeological \u0027events\u0027. The results suggest that Bronze Age activity in the form of a mortuary enclosure and associated cremation burials are probably not contemporary with the palynological evidence for disturbance to the oak-hazel woodland in this period. Subsequent evidence for local woodland clearance and agriculture is estimated to precede the construction of the large Iron Age enclosure in 372 BC, with increases in \u0027anthropogenic indicators\u0027 following this \u0027event\u0027. The construction of the site does not appear to have had a pronounced impact on the local vegetation, with hazel the only woody taxon to show clear reductions. Despite the use of a substantial number of oak timbers in the enclosure palisade, percentages of oak remain remarkably stable. Later farming activity on the site probably post-dates the end of activity in the enclosures.

Excavations at Grove\u0027s Creek Site (09CH71), Skidaway Island, Georgia were conducted to determine the season of occupation of the site. Paleoethnobotanical and zooarchaeological data were used to determine the subsistence strategies of the inhabitants. Stable isotope analysis of oyster shells is combined with the faunal and botanical data to determine the seasons of occupation of the site. The most notable discovery was the diversity of agricultural plants. Paleoethnobotanical data indicate a spring through autumn occupation, and the stable isotope data indicate winter through summer. Faunal data suggest occupation from spring through early winter. Therefore, the site was occupied year-round. This information, coupled with other data from the Southeastern U.S. Atlantic Coast, suggests a revision to existing subsistence and settlement pattern models. Coastal peoples lived in permanent villages and relied on a mix of agriculture, hunting, fishing, and gathering. Short trips were likely made to procure some resources, but there was not an extensive seasonal round.

La información paleoetnobotá nica indica una ocupación de la primavera al otoño, y los datos del isótopo estable señalan que ocurrió del invierno al verano, en tanto la información faunística sugiere una ocupación de la primavera y hasta principios del invierno, es decir, que el sitio estaba ocupado todo el año. Esta información combinada con otros datos de la Costa Atlántica del sureste de los Estados Unidos, sugiere un cambio en los modelos existentes de subsistencia y patrón de asentamiento.

Several Paleolithic sites with lithic assemblages attributable to the Acheulean Industrial Complex (Mode 2) have yielded bifacial bone artifacts. Many of these bone implements are similar to classic handaxes in plan shape. The arbitrary imposition of form represented by these bone bifaces suggests the deliberate application of certain operational concepts that originate from particular Acheulean technological behaviors, namely, stone handaxe manufacture. In addition, the presence of these bone tools suggests an application of specific reductive techniques that originated in both Mode 1 (i.e., Oldowan) and Mode 2 (i.e., Acheulean) lithic technologies. How does the Acheulean model for stone biface shape compare to that observed for bone biface shape? In order to understand the degree to which Acheulean stone bifaces may have served as a model of form in flaked bone technology, an objective method for evaluating form is necessary. The dimensionless approach of geometric morphometrics was applied to the study of 2D bone and stone biface plan shape. The similarity of bone and stone bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene (∼300 kya) Acheulean site Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy was evaluated by a geometric morphometric analysis of 2D outlines. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in the 2D shape of each artifact material class was tested by principal component analysis (PCA) and MANOVA/CVA of eigenshape scores. Results of the analysis show no significant difference between the plan morphology of bone and stone bifaces. These results may indicate that Acheulean concepts of preferred 2D shape were applied in the production of some bifacial bone tools and that a great disparity in raw materials did not significantly influence 2D biface morphology. Furthermore, these results lend support to the idea that Mode 2 stone flaking techniques and tool types were directly applied to bone materials in some instances. © 2010 Springer-Verlag New York.","source":"Scopus","title":"A geometric morphometric assessment of plan shape in bone and stone acheulean bifaces from the Middle Pleistocene site of Castel di Guido, Latium, Italy","page start":"23","author(s) id":"36999872500;","document type":"Book Chapter","cited by":"58","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00199203187250996","authors":"Costa A.G.","doi":"10.1007/978-1-4419-6861-6_2"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":164.70553588867188,"y":12.426846504211426,"id":"1182","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-77649313737","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"2010","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"0.00398406374501992","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Thompson V.D., Arnold P.J., Pluckhahn T.J., Vanderwarker A.M.","x":814.2216796875,"y":-186.75006103515625,"id":"366","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-80051891535","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"2011","page end":"213","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-80051891535\u0026doi\u003d10.1002%2farp.400\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003ddd9fd99a7d4b98aa4071b15ad0c803cc","source title":"Archaeological Prospection","abstract":"Productive applications of geophysics to anthropological questions in American archaeology necessarily involve specific research questions or agendas. While only some anthropological questions can be addressed by shallow geophysics, these techniques provide an opportunity to address some important questions that are fundamental to archaeology. One such agenda is the investigation of \u0027persistent places\u0027, which is rooted in anthropological inquiry and which can be investigated, at least in part, by shallow geophysical techniques. For the next stage in the use of remote sensing that goes beyond mere prospection, research agendas must be clearly linked with broader theoretical concepts of what we term inquiry-based archaeogeophysics. Specifically with regard to the application of geophysics to the study of persistent places, we propose four categories of research that relate to the meaning, context and changing function of such places. These categories include: construction variation, continuity and discontinuity in the use of space, studying natural and/or cultural landscape modifications over time and space, and constancies in the use of space and architecture at the regional level. In order to illustrate these points, we provide examples from sites in Mexico and the USA that represent different time periods (2500 BC to AD 1000), adaptations (hunter-gatherers to intensive agriculturists), and levels of socio-political complexity (egalitarian to stratified societies). The use of geophysics at these persistent places contributes to our understanding of changes in the use of space and architecture through time. © 2011 John Wiley \u0026 Sons, Ltd.","source":"Scopus","title":"Situating Remote Sensing in Anthropological Archaeology","volume":"18","page start":"195","author(s) id":"8263582600;7202944458;6507350446;6507698148;","document type":"Article","cited by":"29","publication stage":"Final","author keywords":"Landscape; Method and theory; Persistent place; Shallow geophysics; Space and architecture","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Thompson V.D., Arnold P.J., Pluckhahn T.J., Vanderwarker A.M.","doi":"10.1002/arp.400"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Flinders P.W.","x":506.4012451171875,"y":-2185.65966796875,"id":"581","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039615303","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1910","page end":"96","source title":"Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London, 2nd Ser.","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","title":"Suggested origin of the Red Hills","volume":"23","page start":"66","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","authors":"Flinders P.W."},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"[No author name available]","x":-787.9153442382812,"y":222.61634826660156,"id":"642","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85039637237","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","author(s) id":"[No author id available]","year":"0","cited by":"1","publication stage":"Final","abstract":"[No abstract available]","source":"Scopus","pr_indegree":"1.0","pr_domain":"9.9601593625498E-4","title":"[No title available]","authors":"[No author name available]"},"color":"rgb(0,68,112)","size":6.0},{"label":"Mackinnon J.J., Kepecs S.M.","x":455.6826477050781,"y":-2392.49755859375,"id":"524","attributes":{"eid":"2-s2.0-85017308858","pr_indegree_normalized":"9.9601593625498E-4","year":"1989","page end":"533","link":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid\u003d2-s2.0-85017308858\u0026doi\u003d10.2307%2f280780\u0026partnerID\u003d40\u0026md5\u003dfa5602c79fa6b70bf57d1f1eb17fec12","source title":"American Antiquity","abstract":"The discovery of a number of prehispanic saltmaking sites on the southern coast of Belize by the Point Placencia Archaeological Project suggests a concern with local saltmaking during the Late Classic and perhaps later periods. Previously, only one small source was thought to have produced salt in prehispanic Belize, and it was believed that most of this mineral was imported from the northern coast of Yucatan. This paper describes the sites located by our survey and offers an interpretation of the local saltmaking process. It is suggested that Placencia salt was inferior in quality to that from Yucatan, and that it might have been consumed by commoners, while elites were able to obtain pure Yucatecan salt.
